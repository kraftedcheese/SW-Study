I’m asking for a friend, I hope you can help.

My girlfriend went to bed crying on New Year’s Eve. This year a close friend and work colleague killed herself after a long battle with depression, and another colleague is just now checking into a clinic, also for depression. Seeing the year tick over without her friend feels bad, but she can deal with that. She told me, however, that since she was little she’s been afraid of death. She finds it terrifying to think that you just up and disappear and that’s it.

I want to support her, but I don’t know how since my views on this are completely different. For me life is a biological miracle and death is normal. I only find sad that people get left behind to deal with it, and that some people never truly live. If I’ve had a good life and I die, I’d feel worse for my girlfriend than for myself (does that make sense?). She finds the whole thing very unsettling.

I am wondering if she can overcome this fear and if so, how. Any help is appreciated."

It may seem like in the modern world a lot of actual production research is kept obscure by commercial companies for competitive reading (even when they do publish some), and a lot of universities largely just keep their wheels spinning by researching for the sake of research, in fear of losing positions in academia.

ej2yuk,Need some help with listening to a friend sharing her fears.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/ej2yuk/need_some_help_with_listening_to_a_friend_sharing/,MLKing,69,2020-01-03 03:35:24,22,/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/ej2yuk/need_some_help_with_listening_to_a_friend_sharing/,NaN,"I have a young friend who I'm quite closed with, and she trusts me enough to sometimes tell me about her fears when she had a bad day.

She is someone who goes out a lot, recognizes many faces and is recognized by equally many, and has some rough teenage years behind her. She regularly worries about people who act out of the ordinary on the street, thinks people are judging her etc. She cares a lot about how people view her, this is why she is not really open about her worries with almost anyone. She frequents a psychologist, who says she is not clinically paranoid but somewhat leaning towards paranoia. About 90% of the judgmental looks she worries about are probably misinterpretations. When it gets bad, a random encounter can keep her down and inside her house for a day.

When she tells me about these things I rarely succeed at providing real comfort. She always prefaces what she is saying by making me assure I don't talk to anyone about it (hence using my alt reddit account - I can't really ask friends since they know her). I can definitely listen and nod, but that only goes so far. When talking in person, it's helped when I hold her and then eventually just distract her with some ice cream or other care but that's only possible after giving the conversation the time and attention it deserves. On the phone I can't provide any nonverbal comfort so it's much more difficult since I really have to say something.  
Things I can't really say:

* Saying it's probably nothing and don't worry. Generally people don't hold grudges for many years and definitely not on behalf of their friends. And people can make a strange face on the street for all kinds of reasons. Worrying doesn't help a thing. She knows all this already, but I've said it because I think it, and it upsets her because she feels like I'm playing down what she's going through.
* Saying it's definitely nothing - this is not true, as there  are indeed a few people who might hold a grudge against her.
* Saying I understand her. I haven't phrased it this exact way because I don't really understand it that well. We think and cope very differently.
* Also sharing a story about my own life or giving advice from my experience. I knew this is a little inapproriate but I've done it and of course it just detracts from what she is saying, since I just don't have the same experiences and have a lot more peace of mind in general.

I feel like I'm missing some obvious ones."

I am very torn, and I do think it depends on the crime, e.g. if you comitted tax evasion and did your time then sure, go ahead and be a functioning, now tax paying member of society. However, if you misappropriated life savings of more than dozens of families I do think punishment in form of other peoples resentment is justified.

  
I guess my question is, how should life after prison look like? How can you balance between giving a second chance and making sure to not forget why someone went to prison in the first place. Or should you even forget?  


\*By punishment after a prison sentence I mean isolation from society, due to people not trusting the ex-prisoner."

With the population increasing at a high rate from about 1 billion in 1800 to a little less than 8 billion in 2017 would it be likely that there is correlating increase in infertility in the human population to balance this change and provide a ceiling to the increase?

I took a basting brush and brushed off the 'floor tort'. Put them all back in the bag. At this point I wasn't mindful to which one was the germy one, and which one was the 'top' one.

A does not intend to injure B with the gun, but does not care if B is shot or injured either.

A themselves gives B a bullet-proof vest as a present telling B ""to wear it now and see how the armor fits B"". B agrees and wears the bullet-proof vest.

A knowing that B has already worn the bullet-proof vest -- the personal armor that completely and 100% stops a bullet from penetrating or injuring their body, and imagine this bullet-proof vest 100% stops a bullet in a way that B would never be able to suffer from any bruising after being hit that could result from being hit with other forms of armour on -- takes advantage and shoots at B right then and there.

Though 'non-consensual' (B did not consent), it is impossible for B to be injured or suffer from any bruising due to the personal armor surrounding their body that A knows of, and it is due to this fact known to A that A knows prevents them from injuring B that A uncaringly shoots at B with their ""it's impossible for B to get shot or injured anyways so who cares?"" attitude.

What crime should A be charged with in this 1st scenario? If it is an attempted crime A should be charged with, what attempted crime should it be?

Hey, 
So I’m a teenage girl who really needs some reality advice. 

Long story short, my dad left summer of 2019. He basically left while I was in school. My mom tried talking to him and say come back we can talk about it. He kept saying no and said that they’re divorced. I was still in school. I’ll basically just say how everything went. 

My dad came back from a vacation which he spent half in Paris and half in our home country. He came back on May 11 I believe. So I remember asking him before he left to Paris why he was leaving. He told me that he had things and papers to sign. I was like okay that’s fine. So the day before he left my mom and 2 sisters him and I sat down together and spoke about literally everything and my mom offended him I guess by insulting his sisters. But his sisters did my mom dirty. After that we all went to bed. My mom and dad don’t sleep together, I don’t remember the last time they did. So I remember when my dad was in France we spoke via whatsapp, his profile picture was of all of us including my mom and sisters. After a bit he cropped my mom out which was very odd. He was supposed to spend a week in Paris. After that his brother got a common injury in his leg. So my dad went to our home country and spent the rest of the month there. My sisters and I spent exams without him and his support while he was supporting his brother who had a lot of other people supporting him. 

My older sister fell and her ankle hurt so she couldn’t drive home from school. She called my dad asking for advice and he said “I’m eating dinner with people, I’ll call you back later.” She didn’t know what to do at all so her friend just used my sister’s car to drive her home. This might get confusing so let’s pretend my older sister’s name is Sally and my twin sister is named Emily. So yea Sally’s friend drove her home in Sally’s car. My dad was always talking about how I didn’t call him but I snapped and said that he had 55 missed calls from and he was saying how I never called him but the thing is I was. After my dad came back on May 11th he came with his brother. We’ll call this brother Sam. I haven’t seen Sam in about 6 years I’m pretty sure. We all spent dinner together without my mom since she was working. They both decided to sleep downstairs for the night. But before they went to sleep my dad wanted to give Sam a house tour. The odd thing was he showed Sam my closet. My dad keeps some of his stuff in my closet which I didn’t notice that fact until later. They spent about 30 seconds to a minute. The next day the 12th we all spend dinner together again including my mom, the day went by normal. Then on the 13th my aunt’s family comes over and my uncle’s too. Everything was good and they wanted to see Sam and my dad. I was sitting next to my dad and I remember looking at his face and just noticing something was off. I asked him what’s wrong and he kept saying nothing. So I’m like okay I thought it was just me. Later that night Emily and I begged Sam and my dad to let us not go to school the next day. And they kept saying no, no, and no. They said they were going to the mall and that they’d pick us up afterwards at around 12. So we just say yes okay thank you and tell them goodnight and I love you. The next day we wake up to go to school and since my sister drives us to school we go out and my dad is at the patio door laughing and he taped his mouth with scotch tape as a joke and took it off and was smiling at us and telling us her loves us and told us goodbye. It was nice. After that we spend our us all days normal. My sister goes home early from school so she went somewhere with her friends. Near 12 I start calling my dad because I don’t really enjoy being at school to be honest. So I went to the bathroom and he starts yelling at me on the phone saying he’s not finished so we end the call. I go and tell Emily and we want him to hurry up like pleaseee. So we get checked out a bit later from school, and weird thing is, my mom was there and she was smiling. My mom would never smile checking me out. She never wants to take my sisters and I out of school. That’s why we begged Sam and my dad and not her. So I’m like what’s wrong? She says nothing and I know somethings wrong because she doesn’t usually smile for nothing. So we start going home and she says she has to tell us something so we’re like yes and she says “your dad took everything and left.” And we’re like “what?” And she’s like “I’m not lying” and then Emily is like “no this is a joke, don’t listen to her they did this one time it’s a joke.” And my mom says she’s not lying and I’m just like what. And I just crying in the car because I can’t believe it. I wished it was a lie. That it was just a prank. Because I know the person I least expected and love dearly would never leave me. 

So we go home while my mom kept looking at us. I knew something was wrong since I saw my dad at that dinner table just staring to my mom smiling for nothing. We enter the house and the TV and Nespresso machine is gone (his rich sister bought it for him) and then we check the closets and all his stuff is gone. So we can’t believe it and my mom calls Sally and asked her if she came home and Sally is like what no what’s wrong and my mom is like your dad left with the stuff and tells my sister to come back home. So Sally comes home and like everyone is crying and my aunt comes over and starts crying saying why and saying we’d be fine and everything is gonna be okay. My mom calls my dad and tells him to come home and that we can talk about it and like, since we’re Muslim, there’s this thing called Triple Talaq meaning that you guys are at least religiously divorced. And he said it in front of Sam meaning it was official since he had a witness. My mom always bluffed and said “divorce me” some times but she never really meant it. So I remember texting my rich aunt, we’ll call her Roxy, and texting her thanks a lot. She called me and I didn’t answer. She calls my mom and my mom starts going off and her and Roxy starts saying she doesn’t know anything which is stupid since they literally staying at her house while in Paris like you heard the plan they were making up. So all of that happens and I don’t talk to my dad for a week or two and he sends me a song and I ask him what it means and I honestly forgot what he said. Over that I start talking to him, I remember that night when I asked him what it meant I kept muting myself because I didn’t want him to hear my crying. —little thing I left out before, while he was on a one month vacation, I begged my mom to try to love my dad in a romantic way again and that we can try to make everything normal again and she agreed— So after that the summer goes by bad, my dad’s family doesn’t like my sisters or mom. And we spent the holiday there and my cousins started a whole argument. So Roxy thinks she’s the shit because she has so much money. So my cousins go up to Roxy and says that my sisters and my nice cousins are talking shit abt them, and well like we were. We were just using fake names and we were speaking English not Arabic and my nice cousins speak better English than all of them. The cousins that snitched to Roxy, we’ll call them Hannah and Britney who are sisters and Kass who has a brother but the brother didn’t really do anything. We were talking shit about Hannah and Britney but they thought we were talking shit and Kass. After that we get in a whole argument and Roxy was mad we didn’t say happy holidays to her and that my sisters and I waited in the car for Roxy to go up first so we didn’t have to see or talk to her. Truth is, we saw Roxy and said happy holiday to her friend and her and we walked up together. But we had to pipe the child-Woman (Roxy) down a bit so we apologize hugged her and said happy holiday so she could piss off. This is all in the summer by the way. So we go home and like my sisters and I all talk and literally no one gives a shit that our dad left. Like nobody. They’re like meh okay. They use it as a conversation starter with us sometimes. They say it’s normal. Roxy said that we’re fine because if her mom died when she was young then we’d be fine with divorced parents. During the summer time before the holiday, I open my dads phone to search something up (I got permission) and I see he had tinder and had a fake name and was 2 years younger and I’m like wtf. So I see the chat and basically I’m pretty sure he was looking to smash w girls who could be another olde sister to me. So I pretend I didn’t see and just say I couldn’t find the thing I was searching up and I even exited out of the tab so he doesn’t know I know. I tell my sisters and Emily confronts him and he said he doesn’t know what we’re talking about and that we hacked inside of his phone. Few months later he admits it was a joke between friends.....

So we come back from vacation and my dad and I get into an argument a week before my birthday because I snapped on him  and said how his siblings are evil and he got brainwashed while he was on his little vacation. My dad went around asking his brothers wives what they thought about my mom, which they replied good things. My mom even told him before that he can go on another break if he wants when she was on the phone with him. He didn’t even have to go to my home country since he literally could’ve done the papers in America which we noticed later. But anyways, we got into the argument and he didn’t say happy birthday for my 16th birthday and Emily and I spent it at our house alone together doing homework. No one really said anything to us. We didn’t have anyone that day but each other. After that his birthday is like around two weeks after mine and I tell him happy birthday and I love him and he says “thank you even though I didn’t say happy birthday to you on your birthday.” And I say it’s fine even though it hurt so much. I was expecting him to call or text Emily or I that day and tell us happy birthday and that he loves us. My dad never apologized for leaving us. 

A few months later on October 24th, he picked Emily and I up from school and we got into an argument because he said something about my mom and aunt and Emily and I defended her. He called us both whores (we don’t even do anything, like seriously) and drops us off at the local parking lot and he gets out the car and kicks us out the car (we were 3-5 mins away from home, he didn’t want to drive us) and like he’s yelling at us and this person walks past laughing and these two news people are watching and one is recording. So my dad leaves and says something which I didn’t understand since he was a bit far and Emily just yells Fuck you and he drives off. The news people call us over so we get close but not close enough and they asked what happened and we’re like nothing and laugh it off and they said “it looked like he was about to beat you guys up.” And we defended him a bit and said no no. So we just sit there. I was so mad because I remember my mom telling me that his other brother (not Sam) said if I was his daughter he would beat me (he said this because my other aunt on my dad’s side lied about me hitting her even though she’s rude asf to my mom so I decided not to say hello to her. This was like 2 years ago lol. And everyone took her side and it was later revealed that she lied) so I texted him and called him a shithead in French and he sent the screenshot to their little group chat they have with the siblings and Roxy texts me and we argue and she blocks me. My dad also blocks me. (I didn’t say this earlier, but Sam even said happy birthday to Emily and I) But anyways we just sat there until our other aunt comes to pick us up and since I recorded the whole thing I show her. She was just shocked really. 

I’m just going to put bullet points of things he did after that 
-Bought my older sister the Nintendo switch lite and bought her a game or two. It was a graduation gift but I think it was to make Emily and I jealous. 
-The uncle said that he wanted to beat me up came for visit. 
-My mom keeps saying that my dad doesn’t even love us and that maybe we’re the reason that he left. 
-My dad pointed out that he actually wanted to leave the day he came back from his one month vacation. 
-I usually cry most nights because I just don’t know what to feel anymore. I don’t know what love is. I don’t know what life is. I don’t know what family is. I don’t know what having fun is. I can’t trust nobody because even blood can betray. Even one of the people I love the most I believe doesn’t want me back. 
-I look at families and get so jealous. I wish I could go back and time and I was the one that spoke to my dad on the phone asking him to come back. 
I miss him so much. I miss my family so much. I hate seeing the people who tore my family apart laughing with theirs. I hate seeing that. Seeing that it could’ve been me laughing. My life would be so perfect right now. Even if we don’t have all the money or shit like that, we would have each other. I miss that and I want it so badly. 

Today Emily said ew about my dad and since Sally was with him he overheard, long story short he said he doesn’t care about her and asked why Sally didn’t defend him even though she did and does. I don’t understand why he says that yet doesn’t defend us.... his daughters. I don’t understand what he expects us to say about him even though he left us. Does he expect good things? Should I apologize to him? But how and for what? I was thinking about writing him a long letter and just taking him out my life forever. I just don’t know.

 What should I do?"

Vaccinating kids without their consent is a good thing, that's why marrying kids or having sex with kids without their consent are also good things ...* 

... *Inducing suffering is bad? That seems obviously wrong. The dentist induces suffering to kids when they drill their tooth but the dentist isn't doing anything bad. Suffering is routinely induced on kids without their consent by various medical procedures. Just take vaccination of babies. We don't ask kids for their consent for, like, most of what they do.

&amp;#x200B;

It is a method in which the government will be composed of ""the cultured elite"", which would be select children who from birth placed in special schools where they are taught politics, economics, sociology— Topics that educate them on the nation as a whole. So instead of being elected into government, decisions on politics and the such would be made by those who from birth, have been taught and trained to make the best possible decision on this matter.

I cant for the life of myself find it.

Can anyone please help?"

A: How does a girl have sex with a boy without knowing of the intended consequence? If they don't know, they shouldn't have sex.

B: If they don't know how babies are made and stumble across sex, why would they think they shouldn't have sex?If you don't know how babies are made, how would you know that having sex makes babies more frequently than drinking apple juice makes babies?Should you also avoid drinking apple juice, just in case it makes babies? It's completely unreasonable.

C: Easily. It's called ignorance as a result of growing up living a sheltered life. Have you never seen The Blue Lagoon?

I was raised strict LDS and homeschooled in small town Utah. My only few friends were other mormon kids I saw at Temple. I didn't realise how pregnancy happened until my parents explained it to me two days before I went off to college at BYU. I thought god just ""sent"" pregnancies once someone got married.

D: ""[I had a friend who didn’t know you could get pregnant outside of marriage until she was 16. She was never taught in health or in biology, so when she was told children come to married people who have sex, she believed it was impossible to get pregnant outside of marriage, and since she was never exposed to anything else in her very christian household, she learned you could get pregnant outside of marriage by getting pregnant](https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/c7t8sx/america_really_needs_to_focus_on_sex_ed_before/)""

E: You see this in children of all ages all the time. A normal part of growing up is conducting games of sexual discovery, with themselves or others. A 3-year-old *will* masturbate. Ever heard of ""playing doctor""? It's what happens when a bunch of curious 7-year-olds lock themselves into a room to, eh, experiment. To deny this or force a child to suppress their normal urges would be absurd.

It's a parent's obligation to ensure their child grows up being knowledgeable about human sexuality and reproduction and learn what appropriate behavior is, but considering many eschew this type of teaching it's unsurprising many (pre)pubescent youths are clueless.

And children do masturbate. Please [check out this article. ](https://www.summitmedicalgroup.com/library/pediatric_health/pa-hhgbeh_masturbation/)There is nothing wrong with it. They get pleasure from the act. Just like many people have sex purely for pleasure.

The majority of us (myself included to one degree or another) are more akin to farm animals than people as far as our critical thinking, morality and emotional intelligence is concerned. So many of us only desire a tribal identity and, honestly, that is it. 

What is leadership then when looking at human beings through this light (Im ignoring the obvious nihilistic question of 'who the fuck would want to lead people given that outlook'?). Are leaders actually people who understand this on some level and direct their people the way a shepherd directs a flock or are leaders people who do not understand this but are just reflecting what is being projected onto them? 

When we look at 'leaders' what kind of people are we actually seeing? What are we encouraging in our children?

Sub question- Why did our species evolve this way? Is there any way (short of GE) to unmake this paradigm of untold numbers of ignorant people being corralled and lead by a small few? Why do we desire this tragic outcome?"

I  really don't know where to start and I guess I'm tired of how bad I am  in social situations. I didn't really have any friends growing up in  High School that I didn't grow apart from or ditched me after I tried to  kill myself.

University was a problem and I always felt left out because of how  poor my family was compared to the rest of my classmates, the pressure  to succeed and because of the failed suicide consideration hanging from  the end of my mind.

I've been working for about nine months now and I've always realized  I've been an anti social person. But I want to be better since I have no  excuse.

I've been trying to more or less get some friends now. And I want to  be the best man I can be. I know that there are lots of baggage with me  because of my past and because of how problematic things were growing  up. I didn't have the support network others my had growing up or did  have the chance to do things they did.

But I would like to be a much better person. And I would like some friends.

I really don't like going to meet-ups arranged on said app because  there's alot of reasons why such people have no friends or go there. Now  I know it is hypocritical but after trying for a year and half I was no  closer to making any real friends. I felt that no one was telling me  what I was doing wrong or right.

But most of all I felt used by said people. It wasn't merely people I  met a few times. It was people I'd seen for over six months.

As for myself; I'm a 23 South Asian guy who lives in Swan Hill. My  hobbies include swimming, painting and canoeing. I enjoy playing video  games (mostly rpgs), watching anime, writing, learning new languages and  reading about Bronze Age Civilizations.

At the moment I've been living in Swan Hill, Victoria for nearly a  year but I haven't made any real friends or people I can connect with.  There's not really any groups for the things I want to enjoy. If there  is no one who lives there is there anyone I can join on Discord or such  to whom I can talk with or be friends with?

I guess I understand why I don't have friends in Swan Hill. I'm a  minority in a small country town who doesn't play football or drink. I  understand that this is my fault but I just don't see any enjoyment in  said activities.

So back to square one ... can anyone help me become a better person? Or become my friend?"

Yes, you may assume this title makes me ignorant.... but let me explain.

The other day, I was looking up why people support bernie sanders. I found a video with a celebrity and sanders. Under the comments, I noticed how someone commented something about bloomberg being a millionaire elite judy judy while bernie was “the man the legend danny devito and the hulk”. I just figured he didnt realize Sanders was a millionaire. I mean that is just something that comes off the top of the head when you read something like that.

Anyways, i just got the feeling that he didnt know. So I simply commented “bernie is a millionaire...”. Thinking that would be the end of it, or I get some minor responses.

Quite the opposite. The first response was “he is worth 2 mill cause he sold a book. Your point?” To which I responded that him being a millionaire was my point.

His response: “thats not a point, anybody can look that info up. You seem to be suggesting that disqualifies him as a democrat or populist. Is that the best gotcha of bernie you have?” Lol. This comes from the man that probably liked the post the had the words “millionaire elite judge judy” in negative context. Secondly, I wasnt giving a political opinion, nor was I furthering a disqualification. I never suggested anything about disqualifying him as a populist or a democrat. Yet this person gets 20 likes. Mine 0. Amazing. Mind you all, I like bernie relative to the other candidates.

Then I start getting pissed and it becomes an argument, where I argue about his behavior towards me being undeserving, assuming, etc etc has his head up his ass.

I got called a trumper, a cow, trying to “gotcha” bernie, etc. i do not like trump, I like bernie, etc. but my opinions were not involved in my comment, but they were assumed to be. I get told off for literally saying “bernie is a millionaire”, have my political opinions assumed, my motives assumed. What is going on. And this is just youtube. Imagine what people do on a basis. This is a complex conundrum there is no single word or phrase for. Yet this kind of behavior of assuming and intolerance and gaslighting and samantics and so forth is causing a greater and greater divide that people are just blind to because what.... of your political opinion? What ever happened to real conversation and DEBATE, not arguments, not even heated debates at this point. Everybody thinks im in some box like liberal or conservative I feel like Im playing some sort of team sport.

Someone PLEASE explain what is going on. Its not just in this post, people act like this everywhere.

Tldr: I comment on a youtube post that calls bernie a legend and bloomberg a millionaire elite. Thinking this person just made a silly mistake not realizing bernies net worth, I comment “bernie is a millionaire”. In the end, im called a trumper, a cow, said I dont like bernie sanders, etc. when none of those things are true. Why does this happen. Why are people so blind?"

On the books , games and TV I have seen , in the Dystopian future they all predict a Ressource War either cold or Hot ( can go Nuclear too). When climate change really start to hurt the planet and essential ressources like food and water start to lack . Things will get pretty ugly . Third world country or poor one will face the brunt of the crisis and can collapse creating a large area of chaos and strife ( specially in the area of equator)  while developed country will retreat and stop massive emigration by force of arm to stop their collapse.

Day to day goods like coffee tea and chocolate are at risk to become very precious and rare  luxury because the areas they are cultivated are venurable to changing weather. The days of economic growth we see today will be replaced by a struggle for stability and insuring basic nessecaty.  

Also a more severe weather and more dangerous world and a more desperate populations who want basic needs  , would allow more autocratic government take hold even on nations with long democratic tradition like north America and Europe .

My primary job entailed some physical activity, but it was slow. My second job is very physical. This was my third day and I am suffering. 

Part of the reason for this is due to being overweight (30 pounds), also having lack of exercise over the past several years, and my age (48). 

I also have a few disk problems and tendonitis in my ankle (I walked too far when starting out about a week ago). I'm wearing a stretchy ankle support but after a while working it is biting into my arch, increasing pain. 

This job is good money and I would hate to lose it . In order to make my rent, I need to work a lot more. Plus, I sweat a lot on this job and it is pretty fast paced so I'm hoping it will be a good tool for losing weight (I'm also on a 1200 calorie diet).

But today I was so exhausted and everything hurt. Feet, ankles, calves, lower back, hips, and my neck. My mind was all foggy and I felt nauseous for a few hours after work. Tomorrow I have to get up and do it again. 

So how is it possible to exercise while being overweight, and not be in terrible pain afterwards? Will it get better?

This boom had to stimulate not only the economy from a consumer perspective, the government simply HAD to be raking in their fair share of the tax revenue. 

I want to say, any president residing over the .com boom era, would have seen surplus rise, whatever their policy and/or agenda for the country was.  

To quote Wikipedia

&gt;he U.S. had strong economic growth (around 4% annually) and record job creation (22.7 million)

To me, ""Record Job Creation"" is clearly an indicator/result of the .com boom. What else were we ""Heavily"" investing in that would give rise to 22.7 million new jobs?  I have not read exactly what amount of those new jobs were ""High wage"", certainly a fair number of them. Regardless, even from the bottom rung of the new job creation (Quite likely, the majority of them), that is still going to generate a pretty revenue stream. 

I think I could go rounds in my own head all night contemplating if anything Clinton enacted, would have had that large of an impact without being put alongside the .com boom."

If there's already one that's similar to mine, please let me know. Keep in mind, this is completely different than the way our current government works (in the U.S. at least), so it may seem radical at first, but just hear me out.

First, I would only fund things that are necessary for human life with taxes, and when I say necessary, I mean Necessary (food, water, protection against others (Police), protection against health problems (both physical &amp; mental) (Healthcare), etc.) The only exception to this rule is Education, but I'll get to that in a bit. Public parks and personal housing would not be included. However, in case of natural disasters that could kill somebody, there would be public shelters for people to hide under until the event is over. This would not be a permanent living space for them. Things that only benefit one category of people (gender, race, religion, sexuality, age, social class, etc.) would be defunded, and all levels of income would be taxed equally at a flax tax rate (no more than 10%). This is to ensure that everyone is actually paying their fair share, instead of having the upper class paying a higher percentage and the lower class paying a lower percentage. Physical money would be obsolete, and digital currency would be embraced. This is to make things more convenient in case someone owes a decimal number in taxes. For instance, if someone had a really bad year and only made 15 cents, and the tax rate was 5%, they'd have to pay 3/4 of a cent. It's a lot easier to put that number in digitally, then literally carve a coin into 4 equal pieces and take out 3. 

As for education, it would be nowhere near the system we have now. Instead of having people who aren't enrolled in school anymore paying for students' education, there would be buildings that act as information centers or databases of sorts (imagine libraries that are each the size of an entire college campus). Things wouldn't be tiered by age or grade levels. Anyone could go in to learn about their preferred study. There would be no forced basic classes (English, Spanish, Math, Science, History, etc.) The only things people would need to learn are relevant to their interest(and if those basic classes really are basic, then it would apply to all fields of study and wouldn't make any difference). For instance, if you want a career in accounting or in economics, you would need to know how to read first, so you can read the info about the subject you're learning about, and then learn about mathematics and numbers, without having to go through filler like Chemistry or France in the 1800s. This would ensure a mass supply of educated people, and therefore, an educated workforce. The economy would do very well in these circumstances. The only reason you wouldn't be in favor of this system would be to admit that you have no motivation to learn anything or do anything and would rather waste away. The most controversial part of this is that I would expect the parents to replace the teachers. As of right now, people are having children but drop them off at school like it's a daycare center until they leave work and can come get them. I think it would make parents more responsible if they had to educate their own children. It would really show if they're educated enough to be a parent or not. If your child is coming home from school with homework you don't even understand yourself, it's a good indication you're being outsmarted. I also think this would be good population control if parents had to teach and watch their own children.

Government would get its nose out of a lot of stuff that it shouldn't even be in, like marriage or fishing licenses. If someone wants to be in a committed relationship or go fishing, so be it. There shouldn't be a whole legal process with it. If two people get a divorce, it wouldn't be our responsibility to fund their court case through taxes. They'll have to admit they took a gamble and lost and should've made a contract of some sort that stated who gets what before hand. Speaking of which, corporate bailouts are a big no-no. They made bad decisions, and it's not our problem. 

Lastly, the government would not be a democratic one nor a republic. Democracy doesn't speak for what's right, but what's popular. It speaks for the majority at the expense of the minority. I hate the flip-flip ""My turn! My turn!"" system we have in place today. Something is either right or it's wrong, and that shouldn't depend on whose turn it is. We keep switch between good and bad policies for the sake of seeming more bi-partisan or fair. I would do away with that. There would be a universal code that all citizens would be subject to, regardless of who's the leader (and there wouldn't be one, not even a council or representatives). All breakers of the law would not be imprisoned within our state, they would exiled out of it to keep the citizens safe and not have their tax dollars wasted on keeping them alive. We wouldn't kill them, but we wouldn't save them either. The big complaint I've heard is that this whole system would lead to a monopoly or socialist state because it would fund protection, healthcare, and education on a universal level. This is not the intention. Tax rates are the same, regardless of wealth. So people that had more than others before taxes will still have more than others after taxes. Soldiers, Doctors, and Educators would not be conscripted or forced to work for the government. They would voluntarily and freely open up their own clinic/school and would have their bills paid through taxes instead of by a single person. There would no price controls, so I don't think the person would care where the money is coming from since it's the same amount. No choice has been eliminated. No matter which doctor you go to, you're going to one, and they would get paid by the money you accumulated overtime in small amounts, as opposed to one lump sump. 

So yeah, please by all means, point out flaws or explain which things you agreed with. I'll answer any questions you have."

I think this is the first real post I’ve ever made, but I need your help. 

I just started working for a nonprofit organization in a small city (in the South, mind you). We do amazing work. Seriously amazing. We find real apartment rentals (not shelters) for the homeless and help them pay their rent until they can get on their feet and pay it all on their own— which 78% are able to do in less than 1 year (with the help of our community partners who provide jobs, counseling, etc.) We’ve housed thousands of homeless citizens, and we remain in touch with all of them to ensure their success. 

Most of our operating budget comes to us through generous donations from wealthy locals. It’s part of my job to log these donations and send formal thank-you letters via old-fashioned, envelope-licked snail mail. 

Here’s my conundrum: we can’t decide the proper way to address these formal thank-you letters (mostly to old-money, wealthy, heterosexual, married couples) in the 2020 social climate.

————

Tradition dictates that an envelope to John and Sally Doe would be addressed:

Mr. &amp; Mrs. John Doe
555 Whatever Road
Wherever, USA

And then when they open it, the actual letter would have a salutation that would go something like

Dear John and Sally,
Thank you for your generous donation.....

————

So here’s the issue—

Every single person in the office agrees that this tradition of omitting the woman’s first name in the envelope’s formal address is weird and outdated. Especially considering that a large percentage of these donations are given to us by the wife. As in— yes, the couples are married, but the wife might be the one who attended the fundraiser, the only one we’ve met, and often the check is even written from a non-joint bank account where her name is the only one that appears on the check. 

So when we get a $50,000 check from Sally and we’ve never met John, it feels weird to thank Sally with a letter that reads— Mr. &amp; Mrs. John Doe

————

Recently, we had this conversation with one of our board members (who IS an old-money, wealthy, heterosexual married woman) and she herself agreed that this is an outdated tradition and said that, if it were her receiving the letter, she thinks it would be nice to be acknowledged in the thank-you just as much as her husband. 

So we discussed the alternate ways to address the envelope, the most obvious of which are:

Mr. &amp; Mrs. John and Sally Doe

or

Mr. John Doe &amp; Mrs. Sally Doe

————

We consulted google to see which of the above was more accepted and found that the internet is in disagreement. Some think that the first address is better because the “Mr. &amp; Mrs.” shouldn’t be separated— and some think that the first address is incorrect because a man’s first name should never be separated from his last.

So, after learning that there was no alternate widely accepted tradition, the board member instructed us to use the old-fashioned way for the time being. 
————

I know this all may seem trivial, and really it is, but when you work for an organization that NEEDS the money and uses it to do super important stuff, we don’t want to do ANYTHING that could miff a donor and jeopardize such a huge donation.

Today, I even reached out to a friend who also works for a different local non-profit to ask her how they address their donors, and she said they also use the very formal Mr. and Mrs. John Doe address, and they also all feel weird about it.

————

So, Reddit, what do you think? 

What’s the proper way to address a formal envelope in 2020?"

The article is here, and is generally very well regarded and spoken about on Reddit:

https://www.cracked.com/blog/6-reasons-trumps-rise-that-no-one-talks-about/

&gt;They take it hard. These are people who come from a long line of folks who took pride in looking after themselves. Where I'm from, you weren't a real man unless you could repair a car, patch a roof, hunt your own meat, and defend your home from an intruder. It was a source of shame to be dependent on anyone -- especially the government. You mowed your own lawn and fixed your own pipes when they leaked, you hauled your own firewood in your own pickup truck.

&gt;Not like those hipsters in their tiny apartments, or ""those people"" in their public housing projects, waiting for the landlord any time something breaks, knowing if things get too bad they can just pick up and move. When you don't own anything, it's all somebody else's problem. ""They probably don't pay taxes, either! Just treating America itself as a subsidized apartment they can trash!""

&gt;The rural folk with the Trump signs in their yards say their way of life is dying, and you smirk and say what they really mean is that blacks and gays are finally getting equal rights and they hate it. But I'm telling you, they say their way of life is dying because *their way of life is dying*. It's not their imagination. No movie about the future portrays it as being full of traditional families, hunters, and coal mines. 

I'm pretty sympathetic to this argument, since I grew and maintain that same work ethic and mentality.  But...that's exactly one of my main annoyances with capitalism.  The reason people don't fix trucks and live in apartments that they don't maintain and move out of in 2 years to another white collar city job...is because that's what capitalism rewards the most.  Capitalism won't reward the guy who takes a vacation day to fix his backed up sink.  It rewards the hedge fund manager who tells his secretary to get someone to do it and leaves a blank check on his table in the morning and expects it to be working when he comes home.  Eschewing kids, focusing on your white collar career above all else, these are things that undoubtedly are incentivized by the state of the market.  Who's likely to make more money when they grow up?  A kid who spends a Saturday riding with his dad to the dump to unload some scrap?  Or the kid who's learning Python?  We can agree that one is more healthy than the other or gives a more well-roundedness, but in terms of raw competitive capitalism, it's clear what lifestyles add to a personality and resume that will be more well received by the market.

I absolutely agree with the author that there is an inherent satisfaction in working with your hands and fixing things and feeling good and tired at the end of the day, like you deserve that hot dinner.  But people in cities don't dismiss that because of what it is.  They dismiss it because an objective look at the market shows that these types of behaviors are dis-incentivized .  If a maintenance guy at the local assisted living community who fixed his own truck and worked on his house made as much as a hedge fund manager, and financial analysts made $30k a year, all those city people would flock to be the maintenance guy.

The reason for the lack of ownership culture and a repair mentality is planned obsolescence, the drive towards efficiency, and ultimately capitalism.  It rewards the managers, the financiers, the people who don't work with their hands and make decisions at an abstract level.  When people say ""Jim deserves his millions.  He started as a janitor at the auto plant and worked his way up to be CEO"".  What ""working your way up"" means is increasingly taking less hands-on tasks and more tasks where you come to work in a suit and look at spreadsheets.  Yet then the same people who vote to not tax Jim will complain about people wanting to be more of the suit guy and not the sleeves rolled up, hands dirty kind of guy.  To me it's always self evident that if we want the rustic life to continue, it would need to be subsidized by some degree, because capitalism will automate it away, and eliminate it due to efficiency reasons, because it is objectively less efficient.

I've never been able to understand this contradiction as long as I've lived.  My rural conservative family will nod along to Fox News saying ""how dare you tax that rich man, while you were all relaxing on the weekend, he was working his ass off to build that company"".  Then when I wanted to spend a weekend starting a website or coding or a service, I get that ""what, you mean instead of coming to the family barbecue, you're gonna be inside sitting on a computer?"" or ""It's a shame no one has family dinners anymore, well that's what the liberals want"".  IMO these people are deeply skeptical of capitalism, but have never been able to look at the issue from a zoomed out, abstract, and objective point of view.  It's always been reframed by the right-wing.  I think these people could easily become deeply left-leaning if someone with the relative charismatic appeal of Trump was able to frame it in the way I've described here.

Personally I believe that the only true and definitive solution to all of the worlds problems that can be solved is education—everything else is either provisory or just an illusion. This means I think a lot about education and how it is working, and how it could be working better, and I think that education is seeing several changes as the age of the internet becomes more and more a dated term, and some are pretty great, some not so much.

So here’s a little bit of what I see and think:

Firstly, I think basic education should be focusing more and more on how to think, rather than what to think, and I think exploration into realms such as philosophy should not only be much more widely present throughout education, but they should also start at a much younger age (personally I went to a school where philosophy was only taught as philosophy in high school, and I had a chance to do an exchange in a school in america where it wasn’t taught as philosophy at all). Subjects such as mathematics and sciences should focus a lot more on the processes and on how to get to the answers than on the answers themselves. We usually learn a lot of stuff that we take as axioms even though their proof is very simple and could be used to present a way to think mathematically. Another thing that I think needs to be much more common is treating school subjects not as stand alone, but as things that are deeply interlocked. Physics and maths deeply affect one another, the sciences in general are greatly affected by the historical events, culture, and customs, and the arts of a given time also tend to be deeply affected by the scientific knowledge and technologies available at that time (one example of this is *Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein*). My experience with learning about the arts and history is that they were so disconnected that I have, to this day, a hard time placing different art movements historically, and thus deriving knowledge from what the times could tell me about the movement, and this is considering that the arts classes *did* come with commentary on the historical context surrounding the appearance of different artistic movements. I think that by tying everything together it is much easier to find the teachings that are so important in subjects such as history, literature, etc.; teachings that are absolutely essential in the development of the student as a person. This is already more than a bit so I’ll stop here so that I can talk a bit about tech and it’s place in learning.

I think that the access we have to information today needs to be taken much more in consideration in education. For one I think it allows much of the content part of education to be moved outside of the classroom, and so the classroom itself becomes more of a place to debate ideas and put into practice what is learned. The teacher is not necessarily the portrayer of knowledge but more of a guide and mediator of learning. Taking history, for example, instead of long expositional classes about a lot of different stuff, the teacher could lead the class with a few prompts about the subject before the class, so that people can do their research with a certain freedom to follow the tracks that entice them, and then the class itself could be more of a conversation where the students share what they’ve learned and the teacher helps them navigate those information, picking “facts” that might be wrong, or misinformed. This is a great way to tie in different subjects for instance. A more scientifically-minded student might focus on the scientific research being developed during a certain age, whereas a more literary-minded one will talk about the works being written at the time. One great thing about this is that people get the chance to talk about the things they’re most passionate about, and if there is one thing I’ve learned after years of hearing people talk about the most diverse stuff possible it’s that there is nothing more engaging than a passionate speaker. I could probably truly listen to anyone talking about anything if they were truly passionate about it. One thing I think is great about this is that by inviting people to actually share their personal studies in the classroom those studies can be put into perspective by the teacher. For instance, one thing I have been thinking about recently is the possible negative impact of the growth of science educator youtubers, because they can give a simplified view of a subject or research area that while great can create are bias in the minds of the person, kind of how CSI and other crime shows primed people to expect a certain type of evidence in court cases and so juries were becoming more likely to dismiss perfectly admissible evidence because they were expecting “stronger evidence” that just wasn’t really necessary or even common. I think that having a teacher that can help put things in perspective can make people take the most out of those educators without the possible side effects.

Anyways, I didn’t intend to talk this much, even because I really wanted to read your takes on this. So, a final TL;DR, I guess, is that understanding should come before knowing, instead of the other way around, and the ways to make people understand is to involve them in the learning process and, specially, mix the subject areas."

She said that he was having stomach problems so he took a pill to sleep and fell asleep on the sofa. He was alone in his home. She said at around 3 AM firefighters were called to the house because people could see blue flames out the window. Firefighters came quickly and when they got into the living room they found his belly was bursting these bright blue flames that began to spread to other areas of his body. She said he had a hole in his abdominal cavity where the ''explosion'' tore it out. She said the cause of death was asphyxiation from breathing the fumes and that no outside ignition sources were found. She then said she looked this up shortly after he died and she said it's possible that the nerves in his gut produced ''sparks'' and ignited the flammable materials in his gut, causing a fiery explosion.

I told her she was full of shit,replied also with ''are you OK? Like mentally?'' and that she was an asshole for trolling everyone. I said there's no medical documentation of people's guts exploding like that. She then got very pissed off and told me that I was inconsiderate because she was grieving and how not many people believed her. She then called me an asshole and blocked me and I'm still blocked.

Human society has progressed (al though I mean in general perception, not in a sense that our story is progressing as a rule) and technological advacements have made our lives longer, healthier and happier and less painful. 

Because of nature's adapt or die rule, humans have through history adapted and only the best survived and we did this, until we became so advanced, we didn't have to play that adapt-or-die rule.

It is too simple (at least in west society) to get food, some research has pointed out that or cognitive functions are getting worse because of phones and tablets, so if humans aren't really challenged by any trials our far ancestors were, and there are no 'real' challenges in this present, won't we regress or not adapt quick enough to meet those challenges? 

For example, we have the nuclear weapons. You have to be knowledgeable and specialized to be able to produce it. If you have it and release it upon Earth, we might go extinct. So, most humans don't know how it works, the dangers and grave danger and responsibility, but at the same time we are not progressing quickly enough to understand all this issues. 

Can this create a scenario where technology is not helpful anymore, since it becomes too complex and we can't understand complexity fast enough, that we get stuck in a kind of a limbo, we don't go back to being monkeys, but we also don't become a new species able to handle all this, and everything gets destroyed or AI takes over etc."

Over the course of ten chapters, Solomon interviews parents and children where the child was born with a “horizontal identity” shared with peers, that makes them extremely different from their expected “vertical identity” of traits passed down from their parents.  

His interviews cover a range of horizontal identities, from geniuses to criminals, trans to dwarfs.

Anyway, to the point of this thread, an interesting ethical aspect he touches on is that medical and technological advances are increasingly providing parents with options to “rectify” (or partially rectify, or eliminate) some of these at birth.  

For example, CRISPR gene editing or Cochlear implants to avoid deafness.  Among the Deaf community, such technology is controversial - a threat to a thriving culture that opens up rich aspects of life to members that hearing people can never fully know.  

Putting the decision to amend a child’s identity into the hands of the parent could signal the end of horizontal identities that the mainstream consider to be “illnesses”. Proponents of this medical / technological intervention see it as rectifying defects, reducing disability and suffering. 

But where is it ethically defensible to draw the line? Some Deaf activists would not want to be hearing (or want that for their children); some dwarfs, proud to be a part of the Little People community, see the idea of any form of treatment as abhorrent. 

What about when it comes to non physical “corrections” - if parents were given the option to influence their child’s sexuality, for instance? Here it gets even murkier; I expect many of us find the idea of conversion therapy unpalatable, but what about if there was the option to influence this before a child is old enough to develop their identity? Research suggests a high proportion of parents would not actively choose for their child to be gay if it was in their control.

I find so much of the above hugely tricky territory, with so many grey areas and difficult decisions. As a parent to be, I have no idea what side of the fence I would fall on some of these issues if I face them in the context of the child I am carrying. So I am interested in others’ perspectives on this controversial topic.

So with real world events, it's hard not to draw parallels with the video game ""The Division"", a game about New York city and the rest of the world beind hit by a bioweapon.

Lets ignore the game, the game mechanics and the crazy technology used  but instead focus on The Division or also known as SHD and scenario: Human civilization collapses.

The Division or SHD is a secretive self-sustaining and independent organistion within the US Government that is activated by the presidents order when the government, law, healthcare and society had collapsed.

The whole purpose of The Division is to literally save what remains which is also the tagline of the game itself and the motto of the The Division is ""Extremis Malis. Extrema Remedia"" translated as ""Extreme Evil, Extreme Remedy"".

The Division is composed of educated civilians with unique talents, skills or personality traits that will be useful when Human civilization collapses. Engineers, medics, former law enforcement or military, psychologists, scientists, analysts or genuinely good and trusted people: desirable traits in any scenario.

To be recruited you have to be selected by the government and once accepted you can go on to recommend people to also become a part of The Division so friends, family or colleagues.

Overall it's composed of people who are trusted, people who are good natured or those with skills that will be useful post- collapse to rebuild and heal society.

Those who are selected and then accepted are to go back to their lives and carry on as usual but are ordered to have go-bag(composed of basic survival equipment) if they are called uponand keep their affiliation a secret.

Agents are above everyone  (military, politicians, law) except the president and they only answer to the president. The reason for this is because agents are independant.

Their one objective is this: Restore order by any means necessary. It's essentially one big kill order because in a realistic lawless environment it's man eats man and the worst of us will take advantage of this to commit even greater atrocities. 

The biggest problem and greatest threat to Humans in a post-collapse environment are your fellow Humans. You don't need proof because you can just go visit r/worldnews or r/imatotalpieceofshit so what the worst of us are capable of.

Not all Humans are bad, I am 100% certain there are some genuinely good people who easily put their lives at risk to save the innocent and weak hence why I'm bringing up this discussion.

We need a backup plan because picture this: the government has collapsed, hospitals have failed, the economy exploded and the law no longer exists, nobody is coming to save you or your family.

Now take one look at China today and the Corona virus. The virus shouldn't be a problem but the economy tanking is going to happen, assuming the virus doesn't become a pandemic because we are still in the early stages.

We only have one chance at this, ever heard of the great filter? We're in it right now and we aren't doing so well at the moment.

So assuming we conquer the Corona virus  and using it as lesson, do you think The Division as an idea is a good idea?"

I've been realizing that most news, reports, and analysis, in almost any field, is about how the ""mass of low-information people"" will react to something, rather than what the reporters themselves think is the takeaway.  It's very rarely a monologue about facts, building to a persuasive case.  It's so often ""Are people going to like the radical?  Are people going to like the moderate?

Every single one that I've seen is simply talking about if they think other people will vote for him.  Even the ones that are ""pro-Bernie"" are ""people will vote for him because X"".  I still haven't seen a single one focused on ""I think that these policies are the best for the country/unworkable/unlikely to get passed"".  Isn't that really weird?  All these expert minds are not parsing the news for us, or giving us factoids and tying together stories.  They're just telling us about what other people think and what they think other people will think.

This is not relegated to political news for sure.  Say in video games.  Most podcasters will talk for hours about if the PS5 being revealed before the Xbox Series X gives them better optics, or increases their ""mindshare"" and if it will lead to better launch sales and if that momentum could be carried.  So few just go ""Hey I was playing this game last night and I just want to talk about how smooth the mechanics are for like 10 minutes.""

Capitalism Ideology run on how meritocracy and efficiency of free market help  produce the most efficient result for all agents of economy by letting Offer and demand balance itself . their is usually three agents in this system , companies that form the bulk of production and industrial demand  the middle class workers that represent consumers and the state that represent the regulator. 

companies compete with each other on the market to offer products to Consumers helping giving the most efficient price of the market. the state job is to maintain infrastructure  necessary for the economy ( electric grid , transport , security ... ) and control sectors that tend to form natural monopolies (usually sectors that require heavy investment to get started like production of electricity or building infrastructure) and help relieve negative externalization that one agent production effect others in a negative way (like pollution , consumption   of resources , noise ...).  

this is a simplistic way to view the system. the thing i see as breaking down the system and make it function ineffectively or a way to harm society. today Capitalism is refereed to it as corporate Capitalism have a big flaw and it is Companies have became so large that is impossible for States and regulators  to control and regulate . we are in the Situation where International companies and Mega companies are stronger then entire states and body regulators which they usually control. Capitalism usually undergo periods of recession and then growth and when an acute crisis happen like the the crisis of 30 and oil crisis the system undergo structural change to fix itself. the problem today companies and financial enterprises are become so large that they block any structural change to current form of Capitalism to maintain it's current power-hold.  usually now after crisis more symbolic temporary  changes are made by state regulators then after a while it is business as usual . it also block innovation in several sectors so it won't compete with them ( like green energy production and medication ...)

&amp;#x200B;

the power-hold of such companies is creating other problems like imposing monopolies or oligarchies in several sector of economies which rise prizes on consumers. a very good example will be the insulin market in united state that is controlled by three companies Eli Lilly Novo Nordisk and Sanofi causing a extreme rise of the price of insulin in united State. Monopolies  are forming in more abstract markets like internet with google , Facebook and other media giants that can control the narrative of  news for people.  a lot of large big companies have been complicit in several large problems in society being climate change or modern slavery . usually when a scandal brake out the company would play the shocked unknowing actor and promise to fix the problem then business as usual.

&amp;#x200B;

Companies are taking so much part of the resource pie and revenue that is not allowing other agents to function correctly . the boom in internet and online economy and technological advances did not translate to more resources for society or ordinary people . we have seen a  rise of debt on national level for states as well on individuals as well as impoverishment of middle class and weakening of it's power. We have an increasing of the accumulation of wealth by the richest and companies  while the part of middle class and workers keep shrinking which is dangerous in long term because it can cause social upheaval and such disparity of  health if it become acute enough can cause revolts and revolutions. 

the current form of capitalism have a social and health price on people and it's future. this a system obsessed with short term profit with large negative consequences on society and even long term prospects of companies. the system run on debt and scarcity have negative effect on well being of people and their development .  the push for profit have contributed a large part for Climate change which represent the biggest negative externality in history. 

So the big Question is how should reform the System to be more in line with developing a healthy society and a stable economic growth that won't endanger the progress of humanity ?"

So much of children entertainment, specially on TV seems to have taken a really overtly ""educational"" to the point where the moments that are about teaching or exercising some skill stick out like a sore thumb, making the whole thing just excruciating to watch for the non-children. It almost seems like small lectures in the middle of entertainment, so it got me thinking if it isn't possible to have something that is better than this, entertainment that really is actual entertainment, that lets kids enjoy the things they were watching without the ulterior motives of the parents, but that can still have a positive impact on them. I think about the power of whimsy, and how it can strongly impact people throughout their entire lives and that I think end up a little bit lost in shows that seem to be forcing lessons in the middle because it kind of loses the connection.

To be fair and honest, I don't really know what I'm talking about, I'm not a parent and I don't often watch child entertainment, but when I do I feel like I see a trend of making the kids entertainment more overtly superficial on the notion that kids can't get subtext, or they can't consciously go beyond the superficial, and so where entertainment geared towards children seems to have been created by people who had philosophies about doing those things -- like Jim Henson and Mr. Rogers -- nowadays the shows that are made for kids seem really to only be skin deep: they're shows that are being made to be educational.

I should also note that I'm 22 and non-american, so my reference to Mr. Rogers and Jim Henson are not from a place of my own nostalgia, but rather from seeing so many people look back on those, and then seeing things like the Kermit The Frog TED talk, and seeing stuff about how they approached creating their own types of entertainment that gave me the feeling like they didn't approach things as skin deep, it wasn't about getting the child's attention and using it to teach them something as a justification, but rather it seems like it was truly about entertaining and educating together and as one.

A last note about why I even care about this -- since I'm not a content creator, parent, or anything like that -- is that I believe strongly that the biggest chance we have of making the world better is through making children be able to make the world better, and I just don't feel like shows that seem to patronize and speak down to children are the way to do it. It shouldn't be about coating lessons (moral or otherwise) in stories to make them entertaining, but rather telling stories that carry in them lessons."

BUT there is the problem, I don't know why I am so stubborn but I can't let go of the things he did or said that hurt me and it often comes up in my mind when there is a similar situation, I then tell him that I again have it in my head and that it bothers me but with that I also destroy the mood between us, I hate it, I feel like I am going to destroy everything like that. I just can't forgive him fully and have those things stuck in my mind. (He never cheated, he is a great boyfriend)
I just don't know what to do, my boyfriend knows about it and I told him everything like I wrote it here, he advised me to do some therapy but I don't want to open up to anyone. I don't like it."

This has changed in most of the world now, the current obvious truth (to most) is that women and men deserve equal opportunity. 

That was just an example, but really, there are SO many things people took to be unquestionably true. People thought that illness was caused by bad air, that babies couldn't feel pain. These opinions were often held by people who honestly meant well and believed they were right, just like me.

Worldwide, 30 countries allow for same-sex marriage (31 if you count Mexico where it is in some jurisdictions). \*  There are 195 countries in the world, and that leaves about 165 or 164 where it is safe to assume that the people generally believe that same-sex couples being able to marry is not a priority at best and actively fought against at worst. I have a bias here, obviously, in that I agree with all these social changes that are happening. I like women being able to vote, progress in medicine that may be needed to keep me alive one day and same sex couples being able to marry.  But I still wonder how we can ever be sure that we are moving in the right direction. Is it as objective as we think?

No movement is perfect. The feminist movement has and had its flaws, so does the the LGBT movement. Medicine has its flaws. How does society decide the 'threshold' for how flawed a movement is before it's not effective or worthwhile, or worse, damaging?

I don’t know the medical term for it, maybe it’s a hallucination. But my entire field of view dissolved to black as I dissociated and not a second later, I was at a beach. I looked around, just sand.

However many of our rights have been construed and amended over many years until we believe them to be privilege. It has all been done for profit under the guise of making you safer.
 Lets take driving and the licenses,restrictions, and other expenses they charge us to in order to exercise that RIGHT. That is correct. Driving is a right of American Citizens....not a privilege you should have to pay to exercise. The US Supreme Court has ruled in several case of just that. Ive attached those court rulings being cited below. 
Here is a excerpt. 
 ""The right of the citizen to travel upon public highways and to transport his property thereon, 
In the ordinary course of life and business, is a common RIGHT which he has under the right to enjoy life and liberty, to acquire and possess property, and to pursue happiness and safety. It includes the right, in so doing, to use ordinary and usual modes of travel. Includes, the right to drive a horse drawn carriage or wagon thereon, or to operate a automobile thereon, for the usual and ordinary purpose of life and business"" -Thompson v. Smith Supra Teche Lines v Dansforth,Miss 12S .2d 784

""The use of the automobile as a necessary adjunct to the earning of a livelihood in modern life requires us in the interest of realism to conclude that the RIGHT to use a automobile on the public highways partakes of the nature of liberty within the meaning of the Constitutonal guarantees."" -Berberian v Lussier (1958) 139 A2d 869,872 see also Schecter v Killingsworth 380 P.2d 136,140;93 Ariz 273 (1963)

These are just a few of the rulings from our nations highest court. So the questions remains. If the US Supreme Court has already ruled driving is right not a privilege, than why are we forced to pay for that right and criminalized if we dont comply? Why arent the members if the Supreme Court not mandating these unconstitutional laws and striking them down?  Why is our government allowed by the courts and Congress to institute such illegal restrictions without penalty? These are issues we want to fight. These are rights the people deserve to be reinstated and recompensated for the criminal rule passed over us."

Reasons I'm iffy to go.

I have been to live shows before and have not enjoyed them. Could have been the environment but it was just a thing i did with freinds. 

Rarely do I ever want to see a band live. I can pay 10-20 usd for a cd and listen to it whenever i want to and not pay 30-65 usd plus drive at mininum an hour and 30 mintues to and back from said event. 

I don't drink or do any drugs really my biggest expense would be gas and any merch? Iffy on that aside from cds if i bought anything. I'm 25 and not a social butterfly like at all. Like I have a hardtime understanding how most social constructs work plus beat myself down plus over think anything so its not like im going expecting to meet people. 

I could be using that time to be productive. Writing, reading. Excersing, learning an instrument, and a slew of other things

Id be going for the tunes not the people. Honestly I do not want to meet the band members like cool if i do i guess? But i just like the things they make not them personally.

Reasons i want to go. 

One of the bands playing on said day is from japan and while I am not the biggest fan, I am aware how rare it is for some metal or rock acts to travel outside of Japan to just play for even a  day. Especially when said bands are not anime centered. 

Gives me something to do in the summertime. I tend to be a homebody in the summmer but i am very active in the winter because i burn easy. 

Thats it really. Its a lot of money to go with ticket plus gas and maybe merch id be looking at a 150 dollar bill for the trip and I am not rich and it seems like a lot for one day."

My mother grew up, got married, and had me and my brother and had a pretty typical upbringing and family. For me its basically like having three families, its pretty nice! 

I know this kind of thing isn’t always the case, but I don’t get why its so ignored, especially for women raised in middle to upper class families, when private adoption agencies exist. 

Now I am a man, so I am not too in tune with this kind of argument and try to avoid it, but this is always so widely ignored I am more curious as to why."

This topic has been needling at me since I had an experience with some students from a infamously bad nearby school. There were some of them who very pleasant and I enjoyed spending time with them but the others were so terrible I almost couldn't believe it. They were cartoonishly awful. I keep putting myself in the shoes of a parent that is forced to send their children to school with other kids like that. That thought just infuriates me but I cannot think of a way to help the situation. This topic, on the surface at least, seems not to have a starting point. So many societal issues are wrapped up in it that I'm not sure where to even begin the conversation.

How do we build and maintain safe and productive schools? What responsibilities do public schools have in relation to the society they serve? What kinds of costs should we be prepared to bear?"

I know this is fairly odd, but we are from separate states, and we've been moving around the country for school/work (and not going to lie, but I've been avoiding the inevitable a bit as well).  Well, we've been talking kids, house, and a dog for years, and we've come to terms with family being a very necessary inclusion in that equation. 

See, I grew up not knowing an entire side of my family because of dumb family feuds, and it created a weird void, so I don't want to cut ties that will undoubtedly affect my kids lives and upbringing.  If they gain nothing else from my family, they will learn tolerance and acceptance.  I've never shared this with my family because I imagine it would be very painful to hear (or they would merely be in denial), but not a single friend of mine or previous boyfriend has ever liked them.  The usual descriptives are as followed: pretentious (that one is very popular), ignorant, obnoxious, or just a$$h0le$.  It's extremely embarrassing, and I'm very self-conscience that I share those characteristics in anyway. It's bizarre as well because I'm from a broken home that experienced a ton of ""have nots"", and none of us are wildly successful as adults. Our only ""claim to fame"" is that we all have very high IQs, which equates to absolutely nothing, obviously.

Anyways, we've taken the leap of settling down where my family resides, and I'm freaking out because my husband is being faced with how much he genuinely dislikes my family (despite my lack of sugar-coating them to him, while trying not to trash them).  Nobody is without their faults, but my husband is truly a wonderful person, and I'm about to explode from hearing all the condescending remarks from my brother and SIL.  All the terrible interactions and $hit comments have made me feel the desperate desire to shelter him from the rest of my family.

I know I can't change them, and I have no desire to take that challenge on, but cutting them off is not the answer. How do you recover/cope with your own family giving you the absolute ""ick""?!"

It was a time to reconnect mentally and romantically, so we left devices (phones, computers) in the car. Sunday was designated our ""Valentine's Day"". 

After playing cards in a beautiful great room of the lodge we were staying at, I suggested we grab the last two cozy seats overlooking the mountains and have some hot cider and chat together. He said sure, but as I sat down with the cider he jumped up and ran off saying, ""I'm grabbing a drink from the bar."" (In another room of the hotel.) I waited for ten, fifteen minutes and he still wasn't back and people were eyeing our seats but I finally ran over to see if he was still waiting and saw him standing just in the door of the bar, it looked like waiting for his drink. I sat back down and waited another ten minutes. After half an hour with nothing to read around and no one to talk to, I went to see what was up and found him. He had an empty cocktail glass and was chatting with the guy beside him. He noticed me and smiled and said, ""Hey!"". I said ""I thought you were coming back with your drink to sit with me "" ""I decided to have a drink at the bar."" ""So you don't want come to sit?"" I asked. ""I'm going to have one more drink."" At this point I was pretty hurt so I just said, ""Okay, then I think I will just head back to the room. Can I have the key?"" (I was a little snappy, absolutely.) He came to the room shortly after and asked if I was upset and when I said my feelings were hurt and I felt forgotten he said that was ridiculous and that I had embarrassed him in front of that guy and asked why I couldn't act like a normal human being and sit on my own for 15 minutes. When I said it was half an hour with nothing to do after he had said he was coming back to spend time with me and just ditched me, he said my feelings shouldn't be hurt because he was saying nice things about me to the guy at the bar. At that point I said ""I am sorry I handled our interaction that way"" and told him that I saw it was about more than this specific incident to me. The fact that often he seems to forget me (we say we are going to bed to connect and he will be ""up in 5 minutes"" but an hour later he is still downstairs playing chess on his phone,  or I am planning to cook dinner or watch a movie with him at 7 and he doesn't show up or respond to calls or texts until 9 or 10 pm and then says, ""Oh, sorry, I already ate"", or ""I ended up hanging out with X and forgot."" 

He says at this point I should have just joined him and the guy at the bar, but this weekend is to make up for the romantic New Year's getaway I planned that he ended up inviting his two guy friends on, so I really just want to spend quality time with him. 

He then calls me out for being ""toxic"" in situations like this and says he can't see it from my perspective as I had control of the situation and my actions ruined the entire night. I ask for some empathy about my feelings being hurt and he says he is working really hard not to explode in our argument as he is absolutely furious about my behavior.

I guess I just don't know if I need to adjust my expectations or communicate differently or what (I know I could have handled the encounter differently at the bar), but I feel like I also want to be remembered  and prioritized by my boyfriend. Also, I don't know how to explain this to him to get empathy or understanding. Does anyone have any ideas? I love my partner a lot. Thank you for reading this - I seriously need communication help."

P1: Average Person votes based on emotion rather than information
P2: Democracy Chooses the most popular candidate not the most competent leader
Conc: Democracy rarely forms the an efficient government 

Although I personally don't agree with the conclusion I have no problem with the premises. With my cynical and edgy world-view democracy just seems like a ""Choose your own Denise"" kind of a way of running your country. 

Question: Considering this, is there a way to tweak the current Democratic system of electing a government without making it blatantly elitist ? 


Backstory:
(Not Important) I'm from India and people voting based on emotions is very much the case here, we have a low score democracy index, growing up I always thought education was the answer but now it seems people are A) Too emotionally driven and will turn a blind eye to logic when convenient B) Politicians themselves seem not too inclined for educating the masses (keeping education as a right instead of duty)
There definitely are examples in every developing/under-developed democratic country in which people have chosen the more competent leader out of the bunch but (IMO) they are too few and far between to substantiate any proof that democracy is fundamentally broken

One thing I tried was getting a gym membership.  I went to Planet Fitness, as it was only $10.  It only lasted about 2 months before I quit.  I went 3 times a week in the mornings.  It was easy enough to understand, and I went for an hour each time.  My issue is that it was hard to work the traveling time into my schedule.  It was hard to actually get up and go.  I work 5-6 days a week, so I find it hard to do anything on a day I work.

It would be easier if I could do something from home, but then there are too many distractions to keep me from being focused.  It's so easy to just get lost on the computer or a video game instead of doing what I need to do.

This topic has recently become a discussion point for my family. We (4 adult siblings) have a brother with significant learning disabilities. Our parents are currently the primary caregivers but once they die there is an expectation us adult siblings will provide care (both in terms of living with, supporting that individual in day-to-day activities and likely financial support). Our parents will be leaving their inheritance in a fund to use towards the care of that individual. This obviously has made me think about this situation in more general terms, hence the question for discussion."

It seems that whenever there is a mass shooting, the immediate thing people do is look at the identity of the shooter. 

If the shooter is a Muslim, the right-wingers say we need to keep Muslims out. Left-wingers will say we shouldn't focus on his ethnicity or religion. (unless it's a white guy)


If the shooter is a white guy, left-wingers will say all kinds of shit about white guys. Right-wingers will say we shouldn't focus on his race. (they only say that when it's a white guy). They'll also place the blame on mental illness.

If the shooter is Hispanic, right-wingers will say we need to keep Hispanics out. Left-wingers will say we shouldn't focus on his race. (unless it's a white guy)


If the shooter is black, right-wingers will say it's because black people are inherently violent. Left-wingers will say we shouldn't focus on his race. (unless it's a white guy)

If the shooter is Asian, right-wingers will say it's because Asians are losers and nerds. Left-wingers will say we shouldn't focus on his race. (unless it's a white guy)

If the shooter is a woman, right-wingers will say ""hey look, a woman did it! See, women can be violent too!"" and left-wingers will say ""yeah, no shit"".


Basically the response is always predictable, and it's honestly disappointing that people focus so much on the identity of the shooter instead of the fact that people were killed. Of course we should talk about the ideological motivations of the perpetrators, but we shouldn't have to racialize them. And we *should* talk about the differences in how the media covers perpetrators of different races. But I hate it when people insinuate that the perpetrator did it because of some inalienable characteristic of his race or ethnic group."

I went to the doctor yesterday morning and was told it was just a virus not the actual flu but stay home so I don’t spread It. However, nobody else does my job, so I don’t have anyone who can cover me. I had to go in to the office yesterday to complete some payroll. My boss was surprised to see me and basically was like 
“while your here can you do this ....” I let him know I was just stoping in to make sure payroll was sent, and let him know my doctor said I might be contagious. I did what he requested then came home and crashed. 

Today I’m still sick. He text me this morning to see how I was feeling. I told him I was staying home sick. However, I have some important documents that have to be done today and sent off so I was planning on doing it from home. Next thing I know I’m added to three text threads asking about projects and such. Then he’s texting me telling me that he needs certain things done. I asked him if I could take care of them tomorrow? He seemed reluctant but agreed. I sent him a text saying I’m sorry I’m not in today, but I really don’t want to get anyone sick. 

My job has a lot of deadlines and I’m kind of the only one who can do what needs to be done. If he really had to, my boss could do some of these things. But I feel like I should be able to take a sick day or go on Vacation without having work contact me several times a day.

The following morning, someone went into the car and took my purse, and a few other items. Luckily, I had my debit card on me, and no cash in there.

Me: ""Well, I don't think that if you were to punch the one that punched you then that would mean that now it's you who can be punched again. Revenge is supposed to make both parties equal by having the one who gave punishment receive punishment. If someone punches you in the face and you punch them back, they can't say that now they will punch you to even things since your punching them back was itself to even things, in retribution. When you punched them back you both ended up receiving a punch which means you are now equal.""

Classmate: ""You proceed from the assumptions that punching the one who punched is justice, but that's not necessarily true. If we agree that punching is unjust, by doing ""one punch for one punch"" you may actually get more injustice, because you had one person who committed something unjust by punching, and now you have two.

In that case you would put voice recorders and cameras in every room but how would the storage for voice recorders work since cameras dont have the most clear audio recording?

Evem then is that legal to put voice recorders and cameras in every roon, would that be invasion of privacy if guests come over? Sure be polite and inform them but even then where do you draw the line?
What if the guests say something useful for evidence if an accusation was to happen, on the other hand it is invading privacy if something personal was said?

I truly want to give my little contribution, but I feel blocked and I don't know what to do.

I just want to be useful in this situation, but there are a lot of things holding me back: what if he doesn't want people outside his close family members to know that he attempted suicide because he feels embarrassed about it? What if I try to be supportive, but end up saying something wrong? Should I text him and ask him how he feels or it's better to give this poor man some personal space and privacy? What can I (or better, what can WE: me and my boyfriend) do to cheer him up a bit? Should I actually try to do something? Is it better to leave this to doctors prepared for this situation and just try to act like nothing happened because I'm not supposed to do anything/I might be inappropriate like those self-help bullshit gurus? If I act as nothing happened will he think nobody cares? If I try to help/give him more attention, will he think we are intrusive/hypocrites?

Man, this thing is so complicated... I don't know what to do, I'm so scared of doing something wrong and to damage someone both by doing and not doing anything...

If I'm being somehow disrespectful, I'm sorry. Didn't mean to hurt anybody with this post. I'm just trying to help...

\[Just a few info about the relationship I have with my boyfriend's dad. I know him just superficially, despite the fact that I and my boyfriend have been together for almost 5 years. Part of the reason is that he is extremely introverted and doesn't apparently love to be exposed or speak about himself. Unfortunately, his marriage with my bf's mom didn't go well, therefore he moved away and has been living alone for a year, more or less, so I really saw him a bunch of times. However, we had also some rare nice ""family"" moments all together: me, he and my bf went together to a concert once, and since he left home to live alone we invited him to eat homemade meals and sweets in my bf's home and in mine too.\]"

According to Wikipedia, ""[cognitive distortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion) are thoughts that cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately"". It is a negative outlook on reality, sometimes called negative schemas (or schemata), and can reinforce negative emotions and thoughts. 

[Image of examples of cognitive distortion](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QXDoO.jpg) 

#My question
[Methods on how to identify cognitive distortions](https://blog.cognifit.com/cognitive-distortions/#Learn_to_identify_Cognitive_Distortions) are:

- Reflect on your thoughts
- Question yourself
- Try to know other people point of view
- Look for reliable sources of information
- Develop your critical thinking
- Ask your loved ones

However, it doesn't answer this question: if you have already done all of this, yet still getting accused for having them, then what would you do? Many people may say that ""it's time to move on"", but let's say this is important enough for you to keep being there."

The first two days working here I witnessed 3 full blown dog fights, and recieved a dog bite from one, due to lack of training in breaking them up. The moments following after the first dog fights I ever saw, were lead with my employer speaking on how they have been working woth those dogs and they are doing so much better, but every so often they do attack, and we have to be ready. There have been many more dog attacks since then, and although most have not lead to injuries, I still believe the amount we have is unacceptable. Finally, I see many times on advertisements and fliers that the staff is highly trained and cirtified. I do not feel I was trained much on breaking up dog fights, nor do I believe I am certified in anything pertaining to this job.
Now for the most current situation, on February 26th at roughly 430 pm, in large daycare a dog named Baxter, who my coworkers know to natoriously start fights and snap at other dogs, went after a dog named Patton. It began out of my line of sight, I could not react until it was in front of me and I saw Baxter lunging at and biting at Patton, to which, as per what my employer showed me, I grabbed Baxter's hind legs, and yanked him backwards. The paperwork my boss provided to us explains this is a technique to 'snap'a dog out of it. It says the dog with turn around and see a person, and no longer be engaged. Following that, I let go once Baxter spun his head around. Once I let go, Baxter immedietely lunged at Patton again, and clung to Patton's leg. I'm not sure what happened Immdietely following this, this is when the adrenaline hit, but I do clearly rememebr trying to break them up in any way I could, then running to the back door to let my cooworker in so she could help. Around that time, Patton ran over to my coworker, and my boss had come in to collect two dogs to go home. I go to my boss and inform him that Baxter went after Patton, while my coworker checks on Patton's wounds. My boss ignores it and takes the two dogs out to their owners. I wait for quite a while, having put Patton outside, and Baxter behind the barriers. To which I hear on the radeo there is a tour coming. Still panicked with lots of adrenaline I try to pretend everything is fine and smile as they brings the tour through. Once that was finished, I wait a bit longer for my boss to arrive. He comes in, and I have to retell him that Baxter attacked Patton, and I try to explain what I remember at the time, as adrenaline rushes can cause black outs, memory loss, and anxiety. I tell him three times that I have no clue how it began, if it was provoked or not, to which each time he replies by insisting that dogs dont just attack unprovoked, and re-asking what started it. All of the questions he was asking, I have never been trained to identify a dog that might attack another, I was never trained to break up fights, I was only told one technique I could use, and given a paper on that one technique. He continues asking question after question, to which I cannot answer, I was still speachless, In shock, very anxious from the adrenaline. I was clearly not ok when he was questioning me, which, in turn, made me feel bombarded, and accused, all before he had watched the security video. All the while he was looking over Patton's injuries, he allowed Baxter to be walking around and following Patton, who was clearly cowering at the sight of Baxter. Finally my boss took Patton out, leaving Baxter to be with all the other dogs, and leaving me alone to watch the dogs, clearly disoriented. Finally he came back after watching the footage, and explains to me that I did not pay attention to the signs Baxter was giving off, by stalking Patton and flexing his muscles at Patton. Again, I was never trained to identify a dog about to attack, amd goes on to explain and ask questions again, still making me to feel attacked and as if I was being blamed. I would like to note that this is not the first fight Baxter has started, He constantly snaps at dogs out of anger of dogs getting too close to him, and I hear from coworkers frequently that Baxter has gone after dogs before. My boss asked my coworker and I if we believe Baxter should not be allowed in daycare. I was unable to answer, though my coworker insisted that Baxter does not belong in daycare at all, he is too much of a danger to other dogs, which I agree with given his known aggressive history. My boss' reaction was saying that we cannot turn down every dog we have a problem with, and that we cannot just turn away a paying customer. He insisted that Baxter was a grey area, and that he believes Baxter should stay in daycare.
After that I was sent to relieve my coworker from small daycare, the first time since the event I was able to take a breather, and I broke down sobbing in front of my coworker. I let her go on a bathroom break, and then stepped out to inform my boss I could not finish my shift, which had just and hour and a half left at that point. He had me go to his office with him, where he asked me how he could train us better, i explained to him I could not answer his questions at that moment, I was still lagging from adrenaline. I was very shaky, quiet and nervous. He asked what he needed to do to make the situation better for me. I told him I just need the last hour and a half of my shift off. He asked if I could stay and just do the cleaning parts. I insisted that I needed to leave, because if I could not talk to him correctly, or process my thoughts, how could I clean correctly. Before allowing me to go home, he asked if what I was feeling at that moment ""an ongoing thing"" is how he worded it. I was appauled by the question, it was as if he was beating around the bush asking if I have mental health problems that was causing me to act that way. I felt very discriminated against for having a dissability. I believe my boss does not understand adrenaline rushes, or what the symptoms could be. Fight, flight or freeze is common responses in situations like that. Durring the dog fight I immedietely entered fight, to break up the dogs. Then followed flight, to allow my coworker to help me. Right after the sitaution ended, I entered freeze, making me unable to preccess and answer questions. Or hardly function."

However, I never see any 'happiness' or 'well-being' measures. Even some of my psychiatrists only care about my functioning rather than my symptoms or my well-being.

I can go to work and volunteer, I can function in society and have relationships, I have hobbies, everything that 'normal' people have. However, I feel dead on the inside, my emotions are so numb and good luck getting me to feel pleasure. I complained to one my psychiatrists about this and I got this ""never mind your symptoms, how's your functioning"". Mind you I sent him to investigation at the college for malpractice.

I don't feel happy or fulfilled at all. Neither do those at the support group who are 'stable and functioning'. Whether it's our condition or the drugs we are taking, nothing focuses on our mood and happiness.

May: quick transition from early spring to summer. I could almost call that single month spring.  
June: early summer  
July: the hottest part of summer  
August: less hot and more rainy summer  
September: transition from summer to very early fall, or like summer becomes intermittent  
October: early to mid fall, or even a transition from summer to mid fall. (Like with spring in May, most of fall happens in October.)  
November: late fall transitioning into winter

I'm always confused by this because I don't understand. They say that a person arguing a set of ethical claims seems to always benefit from it. Are we all just sociopaths that endorse whatever moral code is most beneficial to us in the whole? Do we always break our moral codes when all punishments are gone. I feel like I have been wasting so much time on ethics, when it sounds like its all just a selfish sham. And others are also selfish and use the government to make their own claims about what is or isn't ethical, only what is or isn't ethical is always just whatever does or doesn't benefit me?

It just seems to bleak. It's like why do anything for others, especially others who are poor and handicapped and stuff. It's like....those people offer no return value typically. If morality doesn't exist why wouldn't society just turn their back from these people.

I don't really get how to respond to the statement that all ethics debates are just selfishness disguised. It makes me feel like...why ever give back? Why would I not just stack money on money on money and forget about everyone? Why do I feel a sense of responsibility towards others financially?

This is BS, as you fundamentally are only able to use your perceptions of people to evaluate their emotions. Since people's outward behavior doesn't sufficiently describe their emotions, empathy in this sense is simply a ""closest approximation"" founded on your perceptions of them. Empathy can also arise through our projection of our own emotional state. In other words, if I see a horse whipped, I may imagine myself whipped in my head and experience the emotions of it by projecting the pain of a whip or imaging what the pain of a whip feels like.

By doing so, I reduce the enjoyableness of my own emotional state. Thus, being around and knowing of events in the world which have these  properties produce in me an undesirable emotional state. In order to rid myself of these I must also rid the world of these events with these properties which I believe implies pain.

Thus we arrive that Empathy causes pain for onesself, whether or not it accurately describes the real subject of the pain's emotional state. Shoot for all we know they might have liked it, but the empathetic individual now experiences this pain and will try to rid the world of it.

Is this sufficient to establish fairness as a moral principle for the non sociopath?"

Scenario: My husband and I have another married couple as friends, we have been very close to them throughout the years, they have a good marriage and two small children. They are finished having kids. They are both very vocal about it. After their second birth they found out they are a carrier of a genetic disease and have a huge likelihood (like more than 50%) of giving this to any more kids they have.

I work in IT support for a mid size organisation with around 10k to 20k workstations. This means I install PCs, fix them, troubleshoot AV gear etc. Basically if a physical body is required then I'm the physical body.

So a chap walks into my office and says ""My colleague here has had a PC installed and no power cable"". This is not usual (obviously) but could easily be something someone missed on a late shift. Install everything while no one is around, forget power lead and also forget to go back or maybe the office got locked behind you. I get there and there is more than a power cable missing. No mouse, no display cables, and there is an additional PC under the desk. Weird. Also neither PC has an operating system. This sets off red flags so I tell the user not to use the PC for a couple of hours, set it imaging with our Win 10 build and start to ask questions. 

Over the course of the day I found out EVERYTHING about these PCs. Who bought them, under what budget code, for what project and some background about the people involved. I built this entire picture based on phone calls, looking through our systems for references to peoples names then visiting offices and asking questions or phoning other teams for info.

This kind of felt like I was a detective or something but I really enjoyed it and I wan't to kind of be ""the guy who finds things"" or something. I think I have a decent ability to get info from people indirectly and make connections to other info from what they say. I also have a good memory and things kind of spring back to me if someone says something that ties to what I've heard before.

I have a programming background and I think the same part of my brain is used but I enjoy it way more when it's dealing with people. Broken bullshit code I wrote at 3am is no fun. Speaking to people and making them over-reveal is.

I'm open to almost anything it doesn't have to be IT based, but I really don't want to do crime scene or criminal investigation. Unless it's corporate crime or doesn't involve poking about with dead bodies. I reckon that would get depressing.

[Maybe I will discover a major company conspiracy who knows.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nTpsv9PNqo)

But my question is what job do I want to do? Please help."

It seems so common to hear people say that yuri fetishizes gay women and yaoi fetishizes gay men, that fetishes regarding sexual preference and race are dehumanizing and degrading, and that ""there’s a reason that it’s only yuri and yaoi that are considered to be fetishization and nothing else because yuri tends to be for male audiences, and yaoi tends to be for female audiences, that's why yuri and yaoi are fetishizations of gay people.""

If yuri porn fetishizes gay women and yaoi porn fetishizes gay men, and fetishization dehumanizes gay women and gay men and it is wrong because gay people are being treated as objects and being defined by the features of themselves, then that makes yuri porn and yaoi porn problematic.

If yuri porn and yaoi porn are problematic, then we should ban all yuri and yaoi porn and we should stop creating yuri and yaoi porn. One can not criticize yuri porn and yaoi porn for fetishizing gay women and gay men, but keep watching more and enjoying yuri porn and yaoi porn. That would be as hypocritical as a human that criticizes racism but keeps enjoying being racist, or a human that criticizes eating meat, but then keeps eating meat and even enjoys it.

If yuri porn fetishizes gay women and yaoi porn fetishizes gay men, and fetishization dehumanizes gay women and gay men and it is wrong because gay people are being treated as objects and being defined by the features of themselves, then the only natural conclusion is to ban all yuri and yaoi porn and to stop creating yuri and yaoi porn for the reason that fetishization is wrong.

A year ago at the age of 24 I had a stroke which caused me to become legally blind with optic nerve damage, have seizures, and a neurological disorder that affects a lot of different parts of my body. I had to relearn how to walk properly, do speech pathology, see mobility specialists, learn braille, learn how to use a white cane, occupation therapy, physiotherapy, and learn how to do everything all over with my limited vision. In that year my mom said I was making up my condition and that none of it was real. 

My husband was very supportive and so were my specialists they knew something was wrong but  I got misdiagnosed a bunch of times until finally coming to the right answer. My parents kept doubting me even when I had physical proof of the scans of my brain and eyes. I am trying my best everyday some days I just can not handle as much. 

Last summer she invited me to a family party saying if I wanted to come I was not to bring my white cane because I do not need it. 

They live 7 hours away and I can not be in the car for long distances with my seizures. She told me to wear an eye mask and to stop being selfish. They are both retired and my husband is in the military.

My mom recently has started contacting me out of malice saying I  am lucky to have answers when she is constantly dizzy and has no answers. 

I was not invited to Christmas but my grandparents and siblings were. 

Whenever I called  crying begging for emotional support from them they would say I am over reacting on days I was having trouble coping.

They talk badly about my husband even though he does everything he can for me. He takes days off work to take me to the doctors. I stand up against them and they make fun of me for it.

Today my mom called saying I never applied for the disability tax credit. When I did I just got denied. I had my eye doctor and specialists fill it out. I talked to other blind people I know and they did not get approved for it either. Navigating the health care system and government assistance as legally blind has been tricky and very tiring sometimes it works out and others not. My mom said I never tried and that I was lying.

I needed devices to help cope with my disabilities better but we are living off a single income so I found government assistance to get devices. Once I got the devices my parents complained saying that they needed them more and that they should buy some and they even had to gall to ask to have them. I am not talking about a cellphone or a luxury item these are sunglasses made for people with my condition and a sound device to help me find items that I typically lose because I CAN NOT SEE THEM. They made me feel terrible today calling me a bad person and lazy. I do not have the health to deal  with this I have low energy already.

This relationship is very toxic and I can not handle them anymore its making me more sick. What do I do to cut contact? I have never done anything like this before."

The longer I'm upright, the more likely the headache, which starts at the back of my head and behind my eyes. I have tried 5 different migraine pills and they do not do a thing for any of my symptoms.

Now for the most FRUSTRATING part

I wake up in the morning to ***complete and utter silence***. (I live in a rural area, in a house with very thick walls - my bedroom is just as quiet in the day as it is during the night). 10-30 minutes after I assume the upright position, the ringing starts to gradually come back. Come night time, I literally cannot stand to be in a quiet room because the auditory hallucination that is mimicking tinnitus is THAT loud!

I've also done experiments where I'll wake up every 2 hours, but I'll be lying in bed for 15 hours. At hour 6 the ringing is still there, but mild, at about 30-40% of what it was before bed, and after 15 hours it's gone completely.

I'm having rapid heart beat and palpitations the longer I'm upright as well.

But I am reading about the subject and seeing some television discussion about it . Is current Meritaucracy actually good for democracy ?

The problem the critic see in Meritaucracy that is a structural problem that can be put in a society to keep the same people on top. Being rich means you have more ressources and support and  connections to put in your kids in best Schools and best training which always give more advantage to excel. Also more ressource mean more stable families with 2 partners and less problems on economic , social and emotional level that can effect children.

Another point critic put that ivy or elite schools usually choose rich kids while being considered charity and take support from government by far superior to ordinary school. So you have a basic inequality where the ressource and education on ground level for rich schools is by far superior to ordinary schools. The elite schools take a lot less children while being subsides more by the state they can educate better because teacher can concentrate on individual students.

The critic say we have a system that actually reduce social mobility that favours the state who and that people that able to upgrade their social status is more the exception then the rural . Also he put example where the society is being pushed upward and downward most are becoming poorer while a few are getting richer.  He put the example of taxi driver that used to be a medium skilled job because you had to know the city but with the introduction of uber and gps map with cells it was reduced to a lower level job. So a taxman can't became a app developer for uber or a manager in uber highly reducing social mobility to a few. 

The elite student create a condition that you have to excel to succeed.  Meritsucracy introduce  high stress imperative to succeed that even pressure rich kids and usually people resort to cutthroat tactics and cheating . It create an system of extreme competition and stress that isn't even good for upper class . The system also reduce the importance that you can be good in a activity but you have excel in a few select activities to be able to thrive. He put the example of how you have push of high level students that go into finance  while he see it doesn't offer that much positive value for the real economy and society.

Why would they be faked? For what reason? I don't see any problem with these articles and there are hundreds of separate news stories from different years and news sources (including reputable news sources) of the same type of event.

My friend posted them in a sub to warn people not to sleep in modern cars with the windows rolled up and the vents off because modern cars lack adequate passive air exchange and a person will use up air faster than its replenished, and everyone was downvoting them saying the news articles are all fake. Why?

My friend clarified that cars are not airtight but that doesn't mean that a person can't use up oxygen in the car faster than new oxygen comes into the car.

CO2 poisoning is another factor as well and can kill much quicker than oxygen deprivation can, as well. If there's poor air exchange because modern cars are more tightly sealed than older cars, toxic levels of CO2 could feasibly build up over time."

I have been working in restaurants all my life. My current job I have been at for 10 years. I work long hours and have no benefits other than free (unhealthy) food. I need a change, as I am in my 30s, married, and want to have kids. I want to have a more stable 9 to 5 kind of job that would give me a stable 40 hour work week. Ideally one with benefits so I can get insurance and saving for retirement.

What kind of careers should I look into, and where can I look? Websites like snagajob or indeed show nothing but retail and restaurants. Someone mentioned IT to me, but I don't even know what that could mean or where to look."

And sometimes the answer is even obvious, like oh he cheated on you and then beat you for confronting him about it, but you still love him so you wanna know what to do? 

Also, sometimes the question obviously only shares a small perspective and most of the answers are extreme. Only the people in the relationship know the whole story. I would find it uncomfortable telling strangers personal (and sometimes graphic) details about my relationship. Or how would my partner feel that I am bashing him online and sharing personal details even though I have no intentions of breaking up with him/her? Even I would feel bad/embarrassed talking trash about my significant other to a bunch of people who are biased towards me as they only see my perspective. Like how do they expect strangers to help them with advice? What kind of people do they think are on there? Therapists and counselors who have made their money and are now bored so they just randomly give advice on there? Or people with dysfunctional relationships subscribed on there advising each other? 

Is it a possibility that most people are just practicing their creative writing on there? Like I am surprised that so many people head to the internet first before communicating with their partners. Also, is a possibility that these relationship subreddits are actually beneficial and have some positive aspect to it?"

Excerpts:

&gt;On any day of the year, more than 200,000 Americans are wearing electronic ankle monitors that allow courts, police or corrections authorities to track their movements as a condition of their release from prison.

&gt;...a new study in the Cardozo Law Review argues that in fact they are a form of “digital prison” that not only makes it harder for formerly incarcerated individuals to successfully reintegrate into civil society; they may even increase the odds that they will end up back behind bars.

&gt;The growing use of GPS electronic surveillance, or “e-carceration,” threatens to produce a “subgroup of surveilees who are increasingly divorced from the civic life of their community, divorced from opportunity for social mobilization, and divorced from political and educational life and opportunities,” writes Chaz Arnett, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

- - - -

Discussion:

1)  From 1st paragraph:  ""...track their movements as a condition of their release from prison.""  Not only will EM be expanded for parole uses; the future will have EM being used *in lieu of prison.*   Reducing America's mass incarceration is a pressing concern. Many law and order proponents now agree with reformers that alternatives to incarceration are needed. 

What will those alternatives be?  Do we simply, *as some reformers suggest,* release offenders back into the community after conviction, and urge them to attend a heavy program of education, job training, counseling, and drug rehab (as applicable)?  No penalties at all?  No restrictions on their movements?  What if the offenders ignore their programs and hang out in public spaces all day getting high and continue to steal?

This highly interesting 2014 article from Spain, [Punishing the pickpockets](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2014/04/10/inenglish/1397141607_871230.html), debates how to react to highly persistent thieves.  The headline sounds tough; in actuality the article is mostly a dissent against punishing these thieves with *restraining orders,* which exclude offenders from certain areas. (The offenders don't receive other sanctions either.) The article does not mention EM, but this is the type of situation where it would be used.

2) The *Digital Danger article* is highly condemning; further questions:  How is EM more intrusive than a prison term? Or worse than having a prison record after serving a term--a basic fact of life for anyone who has done time?  Should prison terms no longer be public record?  (But yes we need new laws to help felons find and hold jobs, have the right to vote, etc.)

How does EM bring about all these problems?:

&gt;may increase the odds that they will end up back behind bars...makes it harder to successfully reintegrate...increasingly divorced from the civic life of their community, divorced from political and educational life...

3) *Finally, this:*

There is no doubt that EM might evolve to be super-intrusive *Big Brother Technology.*  The [Chinese Security/Surveillance State](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/china-surveillance/552203/) will probably be the first entity to develop EM to high levels, including using drones to track EM-wearing individuals who violate rules.  Obviously technology will soon allow the implanting of EM sensors  in human bodies.

But EM technology also has the potential to revolutionize the field of Corrections, the control and rehabilitation of criminals.   If America hopes to eventually move away from locking up hundreds of thousands of people in giant brick and mortar prisons (except for the highly violent, kingpin drug dealers and white collar criminals), should we accept broader use of EM?"

So, is NPR the best actual news outlet? Or is this just a function of different media types (TV vs. radio)? Is there something about the longer form podcasts that allows some of them to be a little more journalistically professional, even though they aren’t journalists?

That means a trip to the doctor costs you $100 to walk in at least. If you just have a cold, where you know you shouldn't be working around food, I think you should stay home. However, the attitude of other managers use a Doctor's note as an alibi to make sure you aren't faking. If you aren't sick enough to come to a doctor, you can come to work.

Since it's hard to explain, I guess, some people would rather explain it visually and assign it a color, just to try to make sense out of it, because it kinda feels that way, despite there being none; it's raw, survival information with no language under it.

Threats rank pretty high, and that's why in the most basic form you have ""a bad feeling about someone""; you can't explain it you just do, and you might panic and feel uncomfortable, and hate the person.

But I've failed to see more people really listening to that, and I am very confused because it doesn't sound like the thing you can turn off, but the fact they fail to perceive threats or logically conclude a threat where there is none make me realize; they can't really feel it?...

When someone is to trust, when someone is reliable, when someone is actually angry, when an animal likes you, is in pain, or is dangerous; when animals react all the same way towards me, as if I couldn't hide shit, as if they saw through all the bullshit; they clearly can feel it, I can feel they read me like a book; but humans, are very inconsistent in their reads because they are constantly rationalizing, which is good for complex phenomena, but can totally fail to even perceive simpler things, and to me it's odd, because it is highly accurate, and when you put two people together who actually perceive it, they both seem to agree; it won't beat a long ass detailed analysis, but it beats logical speculation in a fraction of a second.

Maybe I’m wrong. I don’t get it. Why are we implementing changes gradually instead of getting ahead of this and going into partial lockdown? 

 If we know a exponential rise in cases is almost inevitable if we don’t distance ourselves appropriately then why are malls still open? Why are we still allowing communities to gather together? Why are all these changes being made so slowly? It seems like we’re choosing to gradually make the changes needed, in order to not cause panic amongst the public. Why not get ahead of this and prioritize safety over public anxiety. So essentially, governments would rather the virus potentially expand its reach as long as it’s “civil” instead of trusting the public with the truth they deserve to know. This sounds familiar. 

Oh yeah, the doctor turned whistleblower in China who had to be the first to notify his country of a rising epidemic. Dr. Li Wenliang was reprimanded by local authorities for “making untrue comments” and “severely disturbing social order.” His messages about a SARS-like infection conveyed an urgency that undercut the official efforts to downplay the epidemic and its risk to the public. We look at China with strong resentment for allowing things like this to happen yet, if convenient, we allow it to happen in our own backyards. This is a bold statement from the government, that we cannot be trusted with the truth, that we have to be spoon fed bits and pieces of it in order to “help” us. Maybe I’m wrong, maybe I don’t have all the information."

Countries are faced with a dilemma. They need to build the now-famous herd immunity (the UK is a good example) but they don't want people dying.  

If they enforce confinement then they will be able to smooth the curve, and the mortality rate will not increase because the hospitals are overwhelmed but still.. 2% mortality rate is a lot.

After 1 month of confinement (that is what we started in France), let's say only 30% of the population is infected, well you don't have enough of people to build the herd immunity. And you take the risk that vulnerable people get infected later.

That will mean that we will have to be vigilant for more than year, waiting for a vaccine.. that will be devastating for the global economy..

Relieve confinement for the not-at-risk population (under the condition that they don't live with at-risk people) is the most EFFICIENT way to reach the necessary number of infected people WITHOUT suffering a pile of deaths.

In the South Park episode Red Man's Greed, the Native Americans in a move to get the people of South Park to move from their town so they can build a casino over it, they infect a bunch of blankets with SARs. The joke of this being that it basically just gives all the members of South Park the flu and they all get better by the end. The joke that sticks in my head is Randy telling Stan ""Stan, Stan, Go on without me, I only have a 98% chance of survival, I don't think I'm going to make it"". 

With the COVID-19 outbreak, it feels as if many people have a similar attitude,as the chance of it being severe and/or deadly is less than 10% if you contract it. South Park, been seen as a pretty rational show, trying to cut through all the hysteria of the world around them, laugh at it, while at the same time trying to be a voice of reason. However were they ignorant in this case? Should the SARs outbreak have been taken more seriously on the show, or at least not taken in a way that downplayed its impact or its potential impact at the time. Or was SARs way less severe than the COVID-19 outbreak and people did overreact at the time, and South Park rightfully made fun of it. In that case what makes this any different than the SARs outbreak other than its massive reach and lack of research?"

Since my urge to pretend like I know what I’m talking about kicks in every now and then 😂 I think it’s time I share the great news and not so great news of COVID-19 in Canada. 

Here are some numbers: 


There’s more than 300,000+ positive cases that are now confirmed 

It took 67 days from the first reported case of covid 19 to reach 100,000 cases 
 
To the next 100,000 cases so from 100,000 to 200,000 
It only took 11 days 

And for the third, it took just 4 days for it to reach 100,000

Health Minister Patty Hajdu said COVID-19 could ultimately infect between 30 and 70 per cent of Canadians

Right now we have 2,590 cases and 25 deaths 

Canada’s population is 37 million 
At the very least let’s just say 30% are infected, the very LEASST 

That means 1110000 eleven million one hundred thousand people will be infected 


If we can be smart and fast with our approach to dealing with this we are looking at having our fatality rate at about 1% or hopefully even lower 

That being said 
At a 1% death rate it would still mean roughly 111,000 deaths 

Say we do a good job of flattening the curve and end up with a fatality rate of 0.5% we will be looking at 55,000 deaths

Say we follow the example of countries like South Korea and Tawain or even Germany we’d be looking at 33,000 deaths having a rate of 0.3%

Italy right now is nearing a 9% fatality rate but there are a lot of different factors behind why that’s the case 

They have 

64,000 cases and 6,000 deaths 

If Canada’s health care workers are overwhelmed because of a lack of resources or lack of areas to treat, social distancing isn’t enforced, and non essential business are allowed to continue then the number could easily rise to roughly 2-4 %. Say it does get to 4 percent 
440000 four hundred and forty thousand people can die 


 Every 3 and a half four days the cases will double, so the numbers projected here are not so far out in the distance. Rather it’s a harsh reality that is fast approaching

1) He always gets into situations where I have to lie for him (this has been going on continuously).

2) He sent drunk videos of me to random people without my consent. I only found out because his other friend (who I became great friends with now) told me and his excuse was simply ""don't worry he already knew."" I didn't, but I said I did. Btw he kept encouraging me to get drunk, this was the first time I even got drunk, so I hadn't expected it to be like that.

3) He told awkward explicit details about my sexual life to a girl he just started talking to. 

4) I got caught with weed (wasn't even my idea to do it in his house, I warned him) by his mom. Some of the evidence was directed towards me, I chose to take all the blame, he barely defended me. His mom who I knew all my life clearly hates my guts right now, but he either doesn't notice it or doesn't care and he still invites me to his house as if it's all normal.

5) This is unrelated, but he steals holiday money from his own brother's work where he also works at. 

6) He constantly makes me wait out in the cold for him to pick me up.

7) Unrelated, but he lies about going to college to his mom for years now. My mom compares me to him how he works hard and goes to college to this day. I'm having a hard time finding a job because of my ACTUAL college schedule, but I never snitch on him.

8) He only responds to my texts super late at night, when he's done doing whatever he's doing; to meet up with me and play games. OR, he responds when he's completely free to spend the whole day with me or needs my help.

9) Unrelated, but he cheats on all of his girls. Sadly, he makes me befriend them and because I knew him longer I feel the urge to be loyal to him and not tell the girls. At one point I thought he'd change and he still cheated on a really nice girl. The girl was more in shock that I hadn't told her, but I geniunely didn't expect it that time. I even had told her she was like a sister.

10) Remember when I said he sent drunk vids of me? Well, one time I uploaded a perfectly good pic of me and him where I even praised him and put myself down and he within literally a few seconds told me to delete it to preserve his image I assume.

These are most of the bad things I can recall at this moment. Let me know if you guys want to know the good things, but I just want to know if these things are bad enough alone to not be good friends. Keep in mind I've been friends with him my whole entire life, and I looked at him like family. One more thing, is that he makes a ton of promises he doesn't keep or it's half-assed. He'll say ""I'm going to back in 2 hours,"" and comes back in like 6-7 hours or even more. If you guys need more details on any of them I'll tell you that too as best I could without getting too specific."

fpx71t,"What are good non-religious defenses of objective morality (moral realism)? What evidence is there that indicates what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad? Can moral realism be true when there exist ethical theories that contradict each other?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/fpx71t/what_are_good_nonreligious_defenses_of_objective/,Realistic_Abies,1,2020-03-27 21:46:26,44,/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/fpx71t/what_are_good_nonreligious_defenses_of_objective/,NaN,"In the case of morals, objective means that morality is not dependent or based on one's mind or personal feelings. In moral realism, ethics/morality is 'outside' of humans. The very definitions of the terms ""objective"" and ""subjective"" are:

1. Objective: That which would be true independent of minds existing; things like math, rocks, gravity, elements.
2. Subjective: That which is only true within the construct of a mind; things like beauty, humor, disgust, happiness.

If morality is objective, then that means morality exists independent of minds and is out there just as rocks and gravity exist independent of minds. However, a moral subjectivist has told me morality belongs in category #2 and is not objective, based on what the terms ""objective"" and ""subjective"" mean.

Are there non-religious defenses of objective morality (moral realism) that provide evidence indicating morality/ethics exists independent of minds as much as rocks and gravity exist independent of minds?

And can moral realism be true when there exist ethical theories that contradict each other?

Consider the Trolley problem where there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are 5 humans tied up and unable to move. If one pulls the lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks to hit one human on the side track.

On the one hand, deontology asserts moving to another track constitutes a participation in the ""moral wrong"", that if we do not pull the lever, we would not be responsible for anything.

On the other hand, consequentialism asserts that it is our moral obligation to pull the lever, steer to the track and hit the one human on it to save 5 humans. Such a decision would be not only permissible, but, morally speaking, the better option (the worst option being no action at all), as simply being present in this situation and being able to influence its outcome constitutes an obligation to participate and pull the lever. According to consequentialism, inaction is an action and deciding to do nothing is an immoral act.

Consequentalism and deontology contradict each other, what evidence can moral realism present to show which one of the two ethical theories is right?

For moral disagreement, I agree humans disagree about physics too, especially between cultures, but nobody takes that to be a reason to doubt physics. Most humans could just be wrong, and the same goes for morality/ethics.

But humans disagree in physics about things that they can't observe easily. What makes physics possible at all is that we mostly agree about what we observe. If one says ""earth is flat"", then we can show evidence that earth is not flat.

When humans disagree about morality, they are relating how they feel about something. It is analogous to if humans had different opinions on whether things fall up or down. That kind of disagreement would make physics as on objective study impossible. That is the kind of disagreement that exists in morality.

There have, for instance, been humans I talked to that have told me they are ""pro-suffering"", that they don't mind making someone suffer as long as it does not affect them and they do not suffer.

What evidence can I show these humans to make them understand they are wrong, that suffering/pain is bad and that making someone suffer is wrong?

In physics, ""if it disagrees with observation, it's wrong"". In morality, what evidence is there that shows what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad?"

I've had a difficult past. I was bullied half of my life by family members, classmates and supposed ""friends"". 

I'm an only child, my parents had married some years before I was born. My grandmother hated every woman who set her sight on one of his precious boys and terrorised my mom, but, fortunately, my dad was no momma's boy. Still, his relatives' influence was the only reason of arguments between my mom and dad. My grandmother and uncles were very manipulative and even tried to sabotage my relationship with my parents. So there was a constant cold war, I couldn't trust anyone.

When I was in 7th grade, one of my supposed friends betrayed me. She discovered she had cancer, her parents were poor and they didn't afford to pay for her treatment. So she has told everyone that I was beating her and the beating caused her illness, so my parents must assume the financial responsability for her treatment. It was bullshit, but many people from the village we lived in believed her, even though it could have been proven easily that her illness couldn't been provoked by some (inexistent!) blows. I wasn't a violent child. My classmates used to follow me after class, they threw stones at me and called me a criminal, a murderer. ""Why won't you die instead of her?"", they said.

Eventually, the truth came out, her parents found out another source of money and she was cured, but our community pardoned them easily.

In high school, the bullying continued. I was considered ""the weird one"", ""the depressed, the emo"",  I was suspected of self-harm, even through it wasn't true. I was talking to the school psychologist, but it didn't help me much. One of the bullies was the principal's nephew. If I tried to talk to someone with influence, I was considered a liar or even ""an attention whore"", even though I was a low-profile kind of girl. Even my parents thought I was the problem. I just wanted a normal life, some friends, peace, tranquility. So I buried myself in books and focused on studying. I thought that college will be different. 

When I started college, it felt... promising. I've made aquintances and friends, I started going out, I felt happy and included for the first time. But my friends kept changing, many of my friends became involved in stuff I didn't have any interest in (drugs, alcohol, casual sex). So I changed groups quite often. 

In my second college year, the worst thing happened. One of my aquintances raped me. I was at a party with some friends, but they soon abandoned me. I was left alone with the rapist and another guy, who soon left the appartment to ""buy some cigarettes"". I thought it was weird, so I grabbed my coat and went to the door, but the piece of human garbage bloched and locked the door.

It was my first sexual experience. 

I felt dirty, used, worthless, because I couldn't defend myself. I wasn't drunk. But still, I didn't have enough phisical force to fight him. It was horrible. I could not help but think: ""I could hit him in the head with that, but what if he dies and I go to prison?""?

I escaped. Fortunately, I didn't become pregnant or catch some STD. 

I didn't go to the police. He was famous in those times, he threatened me to make me appear as an ""attention whore"", he told me that his word has more value than mine, he had connections...

 I stopped going to college. I couldn't concentrate anymore, the left side of my face was paralysed, my hair turned white, I could not speak properly, I had nightmares... My parents found out and were dissapointed because I dropped out of college, especially my father. Sometimes, my mother would empathise, but sometimes she would blame me for what happened.

After two years of therapy (I was diagnosed with PTSD and severe depression) and work, I resumed my studies, I met new people, my relationship with my parents was going better, I convinced them to see a psychiatrist (they were both diagnosed with depression). I also met a guy who became my friend and later my boyfriend. He knew my past and he seemed to truly care about me. He helped me getting over the trauma, we supported and trusted each other. 

After a year and a half of relationship, I found out he was cheating with his ex. He gave me an STD which he has taken from his ex. She called me and told me everything, he was beside me. She tried to play the victim, but she knew of my existence from the beggining. I talked to him, he admitted everything. He said he did it ""because he's weak and stupid"". ""I was in bed with her, I was thinking about you and I was hating myself"". No apology. I left him immediatly. I'm healthy right now - luckily, the disease wasn't incurable.

I finished college, I have a steady job, got my own house, a good relationship with my parents, a cat, but sometimes I feel alone. I'm 26, I have no friends (just colleagues, aquintances). I almost forgot how a kiss feels like. After the breakup, I focused on college, on gaining independence, but I want to love and be loved. I'm tired of people who recommend me to find one-night-stands or a fuck buddy, that's not what I want. The years are going by, I go out, I used dating apps, but it's sad that no one wants to know me or to let me know them. It's all about ""your place or mine?"". I refused those offers.

I don't know what to do, how to change this situation. I'm tired of being considered old-fashioned only because I want an exclusive, commited relationship. I don't think ""all men are pigs"" after my past experiences. But I don't want to be seen only as a conquest. I won't change what I want in order to be accepted."

The basic plan laid out for the US is:

* Phase 1: lockdown (6-8 weeks), during which the country creates and stockpiles as many ventilators, PPEs, masks, and most importantly tests, as it can.
* Phase 2: aggressive, massive testing for who has the virus (done by, say, unemployed people--you don't need medical training to administer the test); isolation and contact tracking for anyone who tests positive
* Phase 3: testing for who has developed immunity and can reenter the workforce

This plan sounds intriguing and dare I say it reassuring. But I can't help noticing that the people being mentioned in the sources are mostly not scientists, but people like Bill Gates and Tomas Pueyo, neither of whom have the science credentials for this. I'm always deeply suspicious about very smart people's opinion about a field of science that is not their expertise --they're often wrong, but too blinded by their intelligence to realize it, while also being far too influential. Pueyo's ""The Hammer and the Dance"" piece is quoted like it's scripture, when he's the CEO of a tech company.

On the other hand, people like epidemiologists will probably be overly focused on curing the pandemic itself, without necessarily considering the societal or economic consequences. Sure, an 18-month lockdown until we find a vaccine would probably work, but it's completely unfeasible, not to mention that its economic consequences will likely kill more people than the virus ever could.

So my question is: who's most qualified to work out a game plan for beating the virus while preventing a massive recession? Is it epidemiologists, or politicians, or public health policymakers? Or maybe a combination of these?"

I feel like a whiner sometimes as I know I have it good compared to others I know. However my job has no long term investment in me. No benefits or retirement help. 


I would ideally like to find a place that I can make the same amount at, where my leadership skills can transfer over to. A more typical 9 to 5, 40 hour work week would be amazing too.  Going back to college isn't an option, as I don't have the money or time now.

It seemed like they found a good enough correlation that it was blamed on Vitamin E Acetate from ""black market THC vape cartridges,"" so they went with that. 


I do vape (it helped me quit smoking and I’m going to quit vaping as well), so this was on my radar as something to worry about before the pandemic. I’m just a lay person, so please go easy on me if this is a stupid question. I realize that if there was some relationship between the two, the pandemic would have started last year in America, so I'm not trying to push a conspiracy and don't encourage that kind of thinking. 


But I've seen no discussion about their similarities and ther fact that the vaping epidemic was the primary project the CDC was working on immediately prior to the coronavirus outbreak. I often wonder if, had the vaping epidemic happened this summer rather than last summer, would it even be detected, given the similarities between Covid-19 and Vape related respiratory illness?


From Wikipedia:


&gt;Commonly reported symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, body aches, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.[4] Additional symptoms may include chest pain, abdominal pain, chills, or weight loss.[19] Symptoms can initially mimic common pulmonary diagnoses like pneumonia, but individuals typically do not respond to antibiotic therapy.[4] In some patients, gastrointestinal symptoms can precede respiratory symptoms.[2] Individuals typically present for care within a few days to weeks of symptom onset.[4] At the time of hospital presentation, the individual is often hypoxic and meets systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, including fever.[4] Physical exam can reveal rapid heart rate or rapid breathing.[17] Auscultation of the lungs tends to be unremarkable, even in patients with severe lung disease.[2] In some cases, the affected individuals have progressive respiratory failure, leading to intubation.[4] Several affected individuals have needed to be placed in the intensive care unit (ICU) and on mechanical ventilation.[15] Time to recovery for hospital discharge has ranged from days to weeks.[4]


That's the description of the vaping illness [from Wikipedia.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaping-associated_pulmonary_injury) 


[An entry from the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease/faq/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Ftobacco%2Fbasic_information%2Fe-cigarettes%2Fsevere-lung-disease%2Fneed-to-know%2Findex.html) provides further description. 

From the SIRS link in the wikipedia page [4], the report from California listed that abnormalities in lab results were reported, including elevated white blood cells, though tests were negative for infectious diseases.

I have no background in medicine, and my only knowledge of the above is from online research, so I'm happy to learn from people who do know what they're talking about. 

Some general news reporting if you missed this news cycle (there are many articles from many outlets):

I’ve made it clear to her that I don’t intend on marrying her but I can tell she still thinks she can win me over...it’s not going to work. 

My fiancé is who I care about, that’s who I love. She’s my girl. No woman I have sex with will ever be her EVER."

pros:

1- it is cheaper and easier to administer then other subsidies particularly you are giving the same income to every  adult without any  discrimination.

2- it give basic income to people and families to insure basic need and the right for a decent life. the poorer tend more to pay a good chunk of their money on necessities and goods (electronics , furniture ,...) that can stimulate economy and small and medium business and increase activity in the service sector . 

3-Figths an increase trend of inequality where a small portion of the population get richer while a large part get poorer. the rich would subside the UBI with a tax on benefits and wages . the ubi can help alleviate the resource problem between rich and poor communities.  

4-from Andrew Yang , it would be perfect to help people deal with robotisation of work that caused millions of lost jobs and can cause more.

5-Give people the chances to try activities and jobs thy would prefer are good at then jobs ""that pay the bills"" . it could finance and help people try artistic and other cultural jobs. 

6- Give people more leverage in finding a good job and decent living and not to worry about paying your debts and basic necessities.

cons:

1-Basically it will encourage people to become lazy specially if basic income is gone if you reach a certain wage with your job.

2- it would encourage bad behavior to certain people with addiction (gambling . alcohol or drugs...).

Maybe more if you're one of the richest people in the world (e.g. you're a billionaire making $100 million per year, then I think 25-30% is more reasonable).

For simplicity's sake, assume we are discussing after-tax income.

(26M)
History of sexual, physical, and mental abuse from my family. I was the class clown and fairly popular, did drama club in HS and then joined the military.
It just seems like the only emotions I feel like I genuinely have are negative ones. Fear, anxiety, anger. 

I’m sure that’s not really the case, I have a SO that I love and would do anything for. And I think I’m a decent person and I always try and do the right things. But more because I know that I should, and not that I feel super compelled to.

Whenever I speak I have to intentionally add inflection to my voice. I have to control my face to show an emotion. It doesn’t just happen. Sometimes when I’m talking to my SO about my rapes, or feeling bad about people being dead because of me for essentially being born in the wrong part of the world, I have to like channel an alternate version of myself who’s lips shake and eyebrows move. It’s like everything I do and say has to be planned out. When I’m talking to friends over the phone I have to intentionally turn on the charming switch and tell jokes and add inflection to my voice. I can’t imagine how other people just seem to be themselves. I have no idea who the real me is.

I have anxiety and depression and ptsd and panic attacks according to my girlfriend. And I think she’s right but simultaneously, I worry that it’s all just my brain going “oh I’m supposed to be crying uncontrollably, GO GO GO!” And then my night is ruined.

On the other hand, when I am having an anxiety or panic attack (idk the difference, I’m new to this) it feels real. Like a big tightness and my muscles get tense especially up my back and neck and I can’t seem to relax or stop crying and screaming.

I used to not be like this until I got out of the military and started living with my SO. Which makes me think that it’s just being in a good relationship that is maki me confront all this crap from my past.

I have so much trouble with telling what’s an emotion. I don’t know who I am.

As I type this, I am sober as a clam (not an addict, but it runs in the family I think, my mom was a speed demon and I only found out recently I was the only pregnancy where she didn’t use meth. I’m the youngest of 5.) and will try and express how I feel right now.

I’m not working until covid-19 slows and  the restaurant I’m going to work at lets me start. My GF is on her way home with food. I wish I had weed right now but don’t. I currently have a bit of a shortness of breathe, but I smoke cigarettes and weed and don’t work out anymore. My mom was supposed to call my a couple weeks ago to talk about my brother raping me but hasn’t, so that flashed into my mind and my heart got a little hotter with anger. And I’m tapping my foot waiting for my SO to get home.

I know y’all are going to probably say get help with all the trauma, and I agree and am working on it. But that’s why idk if this is normal. Am I jacked up from abuse, or normal and overthinking? I have no idea.

I know this is all over the place so feel free to ask questions idk. Not an AMA so sorry if this isn’t the right place. Idk. Some people are crazy about reddiquette."

I am the only person from my family and friends that works in advertising, so I'm not sure who to go to when it comes to knowing if what is happening is normal. Basically, I have a boss who doesnt approve any of my work and makes me redo everything about 10 times before sending it to the client, a client that doesnt like any of the work that we do and doesnt respect our time and efforts (he makes us work on the weekends and he calls at 11 pm to discuss work) and a creative team that you have to beg to work (honestly they're overworked but sometimes the jobs are small and they still refuse). After 9 months, I can tell that this is affecting my mental health and my relationship with my bf as I'm never free. When we do go out, I usually end up falling asleep in the restaurant (by accident) from how exhausted I am. I know that advertising gets hectic sometimes, but I just wanted to know if this is normal for everyone or if I should quit. Honestly, I feel like I've stopped learning and i dont see myself growing in this company. I'm the type of person that's really shy and caring and they require someone who is assertive and demands work asap without considering the other person's circumstances. I genuinely hate asking the creatives to work on the weekends and I constantly get put in situations where idk what to do. Im only 22 and a part of me feels like it's not too late to change my career path as I majored in marketing. Sorry for the long post, just wanted to explain the situation thoroughly.

The Democratic party would split into:

The progressive party (12-18%) which is split into the Sanders wing which would be less concerned with IDPOL, the Warren wing which is more focused on detailed policy and not scaring the moderates and the chapo-ists who are just looking to make noise.

The neoliberal/moderate left party (20-25%) which is split between Obama nostalgists like Biden and college educated people looking for more incremental progress like Pete or Klobuchar

The African American party/Congressional black caucus (9-15%) which is split between centrists and conservatives (progressives don't feel race defines their identity and won't join a party about race), but united in wanting more voting rights, criminal justice reform and reparations for slavery.

The Hispanic party (15-20%) which is pretty similar to the African American party but a tad more progressive and united on immigration reform from Hispanics being somewhat younger but still pretty strongly religious, although more Catholic than protestant.

The Republican party would split into:

The Christian/Evangelical/moralist party (17-22%) for said people. They would be very strongly focused on opposing abortion, homosexuality and secularism via stuff like mandating school prayer and opposing all Muslim immigration. They would be mostly conservative economically because megachurches are profitable and many of these people were raised under an anticommunist worldview. 

The libertarian party (8-12%) would take a large part of the Republican electorate, like small business owners and people who want to reduce the US deficit or cut taxes/government regulations which the Republicans have only made more complex. They would be divided between small business owners who are socially unconcerned, silicon-valley tech-types who are very progressive but wealthy (this is only around a fifth or so of their electorate) and big business owners/investors who only want to increase their margins.

An economically nationalist 'America first' (7-9%) party for what's left of the agricultural and industrial working classes whose core policies are opposing all forms of immigration, climate change denial and regulation/extinction of oil/coal/farming companies. Socially they lean conservative but are not stringent about it.

Lastly a reactionary party made of the alt-right+whatever is left of the segregationist south, whose main rhetoric points would be about how the US has lost control of it's borders because of the Hispanic population of border states which converts into that political party's strength in the border and also a fierce fighter of equal rights in the south."

g1yw61,Are consequentialism and the categorical imperative interchangeable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/g1yw61/are_consequentialism_and_the_categorical/,hostilecarrot,1,2020-04-16 03:28:47,7,/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/g1yw61/are_consequentialism_and_the_categorical/,NaN," Consequentialist moral reasoning locates morality in the consequences of an act (in the state of the world that will result from the thing you do). This is the basis for the philosophy known as utilitarianism.

Categorical Moral Reasoning- locates morality in certain duties and rights—regardless of the consequences. To put it simply, there are certain things that are categorically wrong even if they bring about a good result.

Drunk driving as an example... Consequentialist thought would find that drunk driving is wrong, only if the action brought harm (physical or otherwise) to the actor or some third party, thereby depleting happiness. According to the categorical imperative, drunk driving is always wrong, as it violates the duty to not engage in reckless conduct and it violates the rights of others to remain free from preventable harm.

While consequentialism values universal goodness, the categorical imperative simply values being universal. Do with this as you please.  


So, I basically have two questions. First, is it better to employ consequentialism in certain scenarios and the categorical imperative in others? Second, have I missed anything in my hypo or are there certain actions which seem universally bad but can be justified according to consequentialist thought?"

As from a few days ago trump cut financing to the institution  saying it failed it's only duty and that is an institution controlled by China . Trump may have political reasons for decisions but the question I asked how much effective is WHO to do it's duty or have become too much bureaucratic and inept to respond to health crisis and epidimies on world scale .

So what do you think should WHO do : is it good as it is ? Should be a restructuring and reform? Or be scrapped and replaced by a new organisation?

For me , i think the institution failed to see the  signs that Corona-Virus was a dangerous threat and didn't launch the Epedemic alert soon enough . The institution also took info for chinese government on face value without investigation causing later a lot problems for other countries.

So what do you think on the subject ?"

When I was 16, this senior 18, John took me out with his friends. We went to a party that was wasted. He and two of his friends had sex with me. They called me a gross and ugly after. They ignored me for a while. John kept hooking up with me. Before all that happened, he was helpful to me and would hang out with me after he would only have sex with me if he was drunk and ignore me the rest of the time. He would never want to talk to me only about sex.


He left for the military over the years he kept in contact with me and saw me when he came home sometimes. He would only want to talk to me about sex or photos. He cheated on his girlfriend with me (I didn't know they were dating). He would have sex with me and ignore me. I went on vacation once, and my phone broke. He sent me at least 30 messages and was mad I didn't respond. He always implied that I was attractive enough to fuck but not date.



He would also imply that I'm weird or annoying. When I was 17, I tried talking to him about the trouble I was having at school. At first, he was sympathetic but then told me to speak to someone else. Because of what happened I was bullied in school, I tried to talk to him because I was lonely. After three years knowing him, he told me he wanted me for sex and nothing more.



That he felt no connection to me. It's been four years since all that, and I feel broken. He still tries to contact me trying to cheat on his girlfriend with me or see me again. I try to ignore him then he'll bombard me with texts it works to face time me. I moved away and didn't talk to anyone he knows. He still keeps photos of me and sends them to me, asking if I miss this. I feel so used and dirty. Something must be so wrong with me.




I blew up at him and blocked him finally. He was messaging me begging for pics, and he now lives with his girlfriend. I feel sick. He recently emailed me saying hey I called him a rapist, a waste of space, ugly, a coward, an awful person.
I want this person to stop contacting me. I feel terrible. I haven't seen him for five years, but he still keeps original photos he took of me as a teenager he's says he took them because he thought I wouldn't mind.I thought he would have stopped when I blew up at him last time. 




He acts like I'm a rude cause he says he's just like that and he's never done anything wrong to me. He even said,”I was drunk too. I didn’t take advantage of you. You just made the mistake of fucking me apparently. Yeah sorry I didn’t hit you up after but what did you expect? You think I haven’t been dealing with shit too? You think you’re the only one who’s got problems? Grow up. Stop taking out all your anger on me. I’m sorry I just use you for sex but I thought that was a part of our relationship that was mutually understood. Apparently not, once again.”


One time when I blew up at him, and he left me alone for a couple of months coming back trying to apologize to me then to come on to me sexually then I went off hard on him calling him scum and saying I wish he were dead also, he lives with his girlfriend
Am I a mean person for sending these messages?"

I am just thinking how would this kind of Justice System fare under public opinion

General rule convictions that are almost based on circumstantial evidence is not given sentencing under these rules. If the defendant is going to be sentenced under these rules the state should prove that this person is guilty without a reasonable doubt.

The victim's family can petition the court to sentence based on the following rules.

In case of cold blooded murder (first and second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter) , sexual abuse of minors.

The convicted felon is awarded death penalty but with additional stipulations.

The convicted felon is awarded death certificated after he finishes all his appeals.

The **victims** families or families are given **options** **annually** lethal injections or medical procedure.

Medical procedure in this case would be removal or organ from the convicted felons body. The organ removed would be such that they do not kill the person but greatly impact their quality of life.

If the state is unable to bear the cost for providing a caretaker for basic necessities only to the felon it could be passed on to the victims family.

&amp;#x200B;

This would give a greater closure to the victims families than just killing the convicts.

I want to stress one point though the sentencing based on these rules would be decided by a panel of judge not just one this could in theory help reducing the chances of some innocent guy getting killed."

Im sure face to face with death wpuld be more scary due to instincts. But i genuinely am not afraid of dying. Its happening no matter what, now or in a few decades.

Why do they need to do this? Why can American businesses never settle on their current size and be content with what they input and output?

Of course, there are going to be some small business owners that adopt this philosophy, but even then, I think most of them still want to grow their company indefinitely. There's always an ""I need more"" attitude, wherein companies and owners sacrifice now to get more in the future. So why not ever chill out and reap those rewards? Why is it so anathema, so impossible, so unreasonable to just say, ""Okay, I have a hundred employees. I'm good?""

g8fn04,Why do black people still use the N word?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/g8fn04/why_do_black_people_still_use_the_n_word/,james20173,1,2020-04-26 22:53:29,21,/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/g8fn04/why_do_black_people_still_use_the_n_word/,NaN,"I'm hoping I can make this post with as little controversy as possible. I've noticed on twitter lately that black people are really cracking down on white people saying the n word, which I completely support. What I am having trouble with is understanding why they say only black people can't say it. I mean, if its so offensive to the point where you dont want white people even liking or retweeting something with the N word in it, why say it at all?

I will disclaim that I am not black, but I am First Nations in Canada and we also have a long history of discrimination. I grew up in a fairly racist city and went to a private school where I was often the only non-white person in my class, so I received my fair share of derogatory terms over the years, and it didnt get any better at public school.

I wont act like im a saint either. I do find some things funny and have said some jokes, but if something ever offended me so much to the point where I don't want any white person saying it or calling me it, theres no chance in hell I would call my family or friends that. Im a basketball fan, so I watched coach carter growing up and one thing that always resonated with me was when he said they shouldnt call each other that because if a white boy said it, theyd be ready to fight, so how can they expect others to respect them if they cant respect themselves.

Again, I know this is a very complex and touchy subject. I hope it didn't sound like I was downplaying the issue, I just wanted to give my perspective from a similar situation. But I know every situation will be different. Just wanted other's view on this so I can understand it from someone else's perspective."

g904we,Is society becoming too soft?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/g904we/is_society_becoming_too_soft/,J1mmy5463,1,2020-04-27 20:53:47,25,/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/g904we/is_society_becoming_too_soft/,NaN,"Take a look at this clip from the Simpsons https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8M2tg2RkIQ. It's obviously satire, but it speaks to a bit of truth, that the modern generation is focused on issues so trivial that it worries me about the actual issues we're not facing and what we consider 'important'.

Consider that over time society has distanced itself farther and farther from the truth that we live in a 'dog-eat-dog' world. The premise of life itself is that other living things must die to keep itself alive. It's for this reason that I think modern I think that everyone should be working to advance their own interests and care little about the problems of others. This is the premise of capitalism and private enterprise. Every business out there is trying to put its competition out of business. Is that ""mean""? Or is that just the same sort of competition that, over billions of years, created life on earth that is so good at staying alive?

So the modern generation's concern over the 'fairness' of the system and the problems of their fellow people has me concerned. Don't get me wrong, I think society should be fair. My idea of a perfect society is one where everybody has complete freedom and the opportunity to achieve success. To an extent, that's the one we live in today. There are still some disadvantages, such as racial bias when hiring, but what is the government to do about that? We can't force employers to keep a certain percentage of minorities (at least we shouldn't). That deliberately imposes outside constraints on businesses that are already supposed to be 100% focused on survival. The more legislation we pass to impose fairness the more we restrain personal freedom. 

So it really comes down to having to choose between fairness and freedom. On one hand you have a completely free society, and anyone can do anything they want. Of course, this is dangerous. You could get killed. So maybe you support some legislation criminalizing murder. Obviously this legislation would be supported by many and would keep you safe. But at the extent of, now you have a little less freedom (you can't kill people). I know, extreme example. So we have a lot of laws that protect us like that, and while they make us safer, they also make us a little less free. I'm not against that. But the more laws we pass to ensure equality, the more they encroach on our freedom. Ben Franklin said *Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.* At what point do we need to start valuing freedom over safety and equality? 

Deep down, we are only interested in ourselves. Everything we do is motivated by our desire for how that makes us feel. If I give some food to a homeless man on the street, and walk away happy and feeling that I'm a good person, why did I do that? I would tell myself I did it for another man who needed help. But deep down I did it because it made me feel good. This is, in all ways, the motivator behind everything we do- for ourselves. It just depends on what makes you feel good. So there is no objective 'virtue', only those who get their sense of feeling good from helping others and those who get their sense of feeling good from striving for achievement for himself.

So the idea of living in a perfectly fair, harmonious society is impossible because deep down we are each only interested in ourselves. A perfectly harmonious society would require everyone to place the good of the group above his own, and that is the opposite of how we are wired. People would not do their part, and this would strain those who are doing their part. Consider the redistribution of wealth in society. There are many wealthy who people who earned it by working hard and working smart for a long time. If they were required to accommodate for the poor in society, who gets benefited? The unemployed 30-year-old schmuck who sits on his couch smoking weed and watching TV and doesn't care too much about improving his position in life.

What I've said might make people mad, that the useless schmucks would be in the minority of people getting the benefit of wealth redistribution. And they might be right because there's been a growing gap in income inequality in recent years which is why the movement for wealth redistribution and 'the rich are evil' has gained steam. But I think to address that we need to figure out why there is a growing gap in incomes for various people, not just take money from the wealthy and give it to the un-wealthy. This ties in to freedom, safety, and security. Wealth redistribution encroaches on the freedom of the wealthy for the benefit and safety of everyone else. I want to live in a society where I have the opportunity to become wealthy solely through my own actions. I don't want to live in a society where it seems pointless to work to become wealthy because that wealth will just be redistributed to everyone else.

This is why socialist and communist countries fail so much. Deep down we only care about ourselves, and these systems try to pretend that isn't the truth. Economic systems like that fail because there is no motivation to become wealthy, or be productive, or to really achieve anything. The USSR's industries were so unproductive because it was in the best interest of each industry to be as *unproductive* as possible to keep the following years' expectations for them low. That really is kind of sad. (For more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3Jkqqlpibo). The only sort of economic system that works is one that recognizes we are all only really interested in ourselves, and that rewards those who create productivity where previously there was none. This is why capitalism shines. It is on everyone, individually, to figure out how and where they can make an improvement to productivity in the economy. Those who succeed will be rewarded.

This is why the growing mindset that government should exist to take care of the people concerns me. I believe government should have a minimal role in protecting us and a large role in ensuring freedom. ""Billionaires should not exist."" I absolutely think they should, for the people that figure out how to radically transform society. People like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Jeff Bezos. Granted, should they have as MUCH money as they have? Well, considering just how radically they've transformed society, yes. But the focus tends to be on how much money they have and not on how much they've benefited society. And I think the more we focus on what wealthy people have, and not what they've accomplished for society, the closer we're going to move to an economy like the USSR- where there is no motivation to succeed and all the motivation to stay stagnant."

I was not sure what to expect and on my second day there a local woman offered to braid my (24F) hair in exchange for about $20 USD. I did not solicit this service - she offered this to me while my group was buying fruit from her family's store. I was going to be in Belize for two weeks. For reference, I am white and my hair was long (down to my waist). It is normally wavy/curly back in the PNW region of the U.S. (where I normally live) and was getting very frizzy and tangled down in Belize due to the humidity and salt water. It was hard to manage, but I didn't want my hair to keep me from enjoying my trip and swimming in the ocean. 

I was tempted to accept the woman's offer, but declined, feeling like it would be cultural appropriation. Later on in the trip my hair was so badly tangled that I had to cut \~5 inches off and spent 4+ hours with hair products, combs, brushes, fresh water, and friends trying to salvage it after a day in the ocean. Part of me wishes I had taken up that woman's offer to have my hair put in braids. Would it have been cultural appropriation to pay her to braid my hair and wear the braids until my trip was over?"

For instance, why are [dog treat factories](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/g9l2w7/this_isnt_essential_employees_at_tyson_dog_treat/) and [candy factories](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/flhkvm/candy_industry_calls_for_500_million_in_federal/) still operating as 'essential'?

Why do we struggle to define who is essential? I think it starts with realizing that society has switched from [70-80% agriculture](https://delanceyplace.com/view-archives.php?p=1126) to [roughly 11% agriculture](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/ag-and-food-sectors-and-the-economy/) in only the past few hundred years.

Perhaps the greatest benefit from all this COVID19 hype is the shift in focus to the medical field.

We've been broken up for a few months now, and although we are on pretty good terms now and get along well and co-parent well, there aren't plans on getting back together. Because of financial reasons, we still live together in the house that we own together, but plan on selling it once everything goes back to normal after this whole virus thing is done and living separately. 

When we were together, there was talk of taking a trip to Costa Rica together for a long time (where he's from). I haven't traveled much in my life, but I am not the type of person who likes the idea of staying put in one place for my whole life, so I've always really wanted to travel to new places. Going to Costa Rica is one of the things that has been on my bucket list for a long time. 

Now this whole breakup thing is making me question whether it's worth the trip or not. The tickets were already bought, and all the plans were already set of where we were going to stay, transportation, babysitters for the kids, who was going with us, etc. before the break up. 

As of now, the plans are still on for a few months from now if the corona virus issue allows it. I really really really want to go to Costa Rica and I was super excited about all the plans, but I still feel a bit weird about going with my ex. Again, we are on good terms and get along well, but the fact that it's with my ex makes me question if I should be doing this or not. Should I just go anyways and enjoy as much as possible, or should I cancel the trip and hope I have the opportunity again in the future? Is it a bad idea? Thanks!"

I know in some Asian countries the parents are always involved in their child life including their choice of major in local university and arranged marriage, so they are never truly independent individuals even when they're adults, which is the extreme end of the spectrum.

I was trying to make this brief but now I’m looking back after writing it am just realizing how long it is, apologies if it is too long. Any advice/opinions/stories are greatly appreciated, as we aren’t quite sure what to make of this and don’t really know what to do.

About one month ago, I stayed the night at my girlfriend’s apartment, and the next morning was when it all started. She was getting ready to take her dog out for her morning walk, and my gf starting putting on her shoes as she let her dog outside. But right as the dog got out the door she started barking, VERY aggressively, like much more than she normally does with any other strangers or other dogs. I was inside and could hear that it sounded like an abnormally panicked and stressed bark, but honestly at the time I just brushed it off and continued to focus on my work. It was after my gf came back inside that I found out what really happened. 

She lives on the second floor of a garden-style apartment complex, so basically that means that her apartment door opens up to a hallway, but that hallway is technically “outside” because the it just goes directly to the outdoors, if that makes sense. She lives in the far back corner of the apartment complex, and the adjacent lot is some kind of old warehouse, so there’s not a whole lot of visibility from other people there. Prime spot for sketchy people if you ask me. Anyway, she finishes putting on her shoes and walks out the door and sees a tall blonde man, with a black leather jacket and a baseball cap, just standing literally right in front of her door, who is staring directly at her completely emotionless and doesn’t say a word. And he also doesn’t move out of the way, just stares. This is while her dog is manically barking at him, but he’s not even noticing or acknowledging it, just staring at my girlfriend who’s still standing in her door. This lasts for probably a few seconds - with no expression from him but a focused gaze. Given my gf’s personality type, she isn’t the type to let this affect her routine, so instead of coming back inside she just walks around the man without saying anything and goes downstairs to takes her dog outside to the grass. As she’s walking around, she notices that the man was still on the second floor, but had walked over to her side of the hallway and was watching her. So she walks over to the dog park on the other side of the building, only to notice that he had walked to the other side of the hallway too, still watching her. She stays outside for about 20 minutes longer than usual, with the man watching her the whole time, before ultimately walking back. She walks to the other side of her apartment yet again and walks up the stairs, and while doing so can still see the man’s legs as he’s standing on the staircase between the second and third floors, at the opposite end of the hallway. As she’s walking toward her apartment door, the man walks down to the second floor, stops completely, and stares at her for a few seconds. My girlfriend stares back expecting him to say something, but he doesn’t. And then suddenly he leans forward and begins marching toward her, fast and holding a dead stare. And this is when my girlfriend panicked and rushed inside as quickly as possible.

She told me this story when she got in and she was clearly distressed. The dog didn’t seem normal either. We had heard a few stories recently about how sex trafficking had been accelerating in our city in recent years, so this made it all the more scary. We’re just a few hours from the border of Mexico, in a medium-large city, so it makes sense that traffickers might target a city like this, as they would have a large population of young women to target, and the traffickers would be able to make a quick escape out of the country with minimal risk when transporting their “cargo” to its destination, where that ultimately may be. This is what my girlfriend and I are afraid of. That this guy is a hired kidnapper in a much larger sex trafficking ring, who had potentially been watching her for weeks or even longer, waiting to make his move, but fortunately hesitated just long enough that day to let her slip by. 

She called the police and an officer came by to get her story. When she described the man to the officer (tall, blonde, blank but focused stare), the officer shockingly asked, did he seem like he was European or Russian? This was crazy because 1) that’s not an ordinary question for a police officer to ask, and 2) that’s exactly how my girlfriend described him to me earlier. The officer looked surprised and then went to his car to talk on the radio for about 20-30 minutes. When he came back he refused to give us any more details, but insisted repeatedly that she always lock her doors, never go outside alone, and especially never go outside at night for any reason. He dodged all of our questions about what other reports there had been about this man and what else he might know, and instead just kept repeating how careful she needed to be. So we were just left wondering what this man could be. 

I convinced her to lay low for a while and just live with me, so she stayed with me for four weeks, during which everything was fine. Then just 3 days ago we decided that she had probably stayed away for long enough, so she moved back into her apartment. 

But just earlier today, he reappeared. She was outside walking her dog when she saw a giant white cargo driving up to her — the kind of van without any windows in the back — and inside was a man smiling and waving. The van was still pretty far away, so she had no idea who was inside, and she just alwaved back. The man then pulled up the van to where she was with her dog, and got out of the van and just looked at her and smiled and waved. That’s when she realized that this was the same man that she saw standing in front of her apartment door last month. She acted casual, and apparently this time he seemed friendly. (By the way he did have a very thick accent, so it seems like he might not have spent much time in the US yet). She said hi and asked if he just moved here and he said “yes” without adding any more details. Then he said “I’m __, what’s your name.” She answered with a fake name and that was the whole conversation. Then she started walking upstairs to her own apartment and he followed right behind her, except when she went to her apartment on the second floor, he continued walking up to the third floor. Okay, so as of this point in the story it seems possible that he’s just a strange guy who happens to have moved in one floor above her now. But that doesn’t quite make the whole story fit together, and we also found out some more details just a few hours ago. 

A little bit about this cargo van - there are **many** things that are strange about it. First of all, cargo vans are the scariest vehicle because they are presumably what a kidnapper would use, because there are no windows on the sides, which means that no one can see in, and even if they were pulled over by a police officer, the officer would need probable cause to be able to look inside, since the inside of the back of a cargo van isn’t readily visible from the outside. A captive might run out of oxygen with a few hours spent in the trunk of a car, but not in the back of a cargo van. Like I said earlier, we’re worried that this man is part of a larger sex trafficking ring, and they see my girlfriend as one of their next targets. The van is brand new, and clearly a new model based on the body styling and the thick coat of gloss on the paint. It looks freshly waxed. No one who worked in construction/shipping/cleaning/etc (the typical legit users of cargo vans) would reasonably buy this fancy new van as both their work van and their daily driver. The front cabin windows of the van have no tint whatsoever, but the windows on the back gates to the cargo area of the van have the darkest tint I’ve ever seen on any vehicle window. I happen to know a bit about window tints, and I know for sure that this dark of a tint is illegal in most states. This means that the manufacturer didn’t put this tint on the glass - the man put it on there himself, which means that he doesn’t want anyone looking inside. So, of course we looked inside. We saw a minimum of 8 different license plates on the floor, and a motorcycle. The motorcycle could be explainable, but I can’t think of any good reason to have all of those license plates. If this were a super old cargo van, I would say that maybe he just let his old license plates accumulate in the back over the years, but this is a NEW van. This means that he definitely INTENTIONALLY PUT all of those license plates in there after he recently bought the van. What could be the motive for that?

The first time she talked to the police, they told her to call them again if she saw the man again or if she had any more info. So she called them today and told her that she saw him again, where he was, as well told them all about the multiple license plates stored in the back of this brand new cargo van. The dispatcher responded that they couldn't take any action based on that kind of info, which honestly makes sense, but also kind of seems like the beginning of so many real-life horror stories just before someone goes missing for good. My girlfriend is staying at my place again now, for the foreseeable future. 

Are we just being overly paranoid? Does this seem reasonable? Is there any plausible explanation that could make everything about this story make sense? My girlfriend and I are trying to figure out next steps, including whether she should ditch her apartment for good and move somewhere else, where that man won’t be able to find her (preferably a large downtown apartment building which I feel would be much more secure). The only plan we have so far is that she’s going to go to the police station in person tomorrow to hopefully get a real conversation with somebody there. All inputs are appreciated."

“Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty 
– some most unsure, some nearly sure, none absolutely certain.” ~ Richard P. Feynman.

What I understand to be a key part of the scientific method and discovery is that it works mainly via induction. Such a style of reasoning never gives a definite answer. Only likely answers. In science you get probabilities, and likelihoods. Never assurance. It’s what separates scientific fields from mathematics for examples. It’s not about the binary yes/no, true/false, black/white rigid conclusions. In this way it keeps science a very humble discipline that constantly finds room to improve and expand. But there’s a problem…

Does this mean science will NEVER be complete? Always aiming so close to the truth but it will always dangle out of full reach. I get it– as humans we are generally insecure about our abilities to obtain complete knowledge of such vast fields. In the scale of the universe, our species are ants. What can we ever truly know about anything then? But one day could our knowledge of some things be complete?

The human race will likely go extinct in some way or another, before we uncover all the earth’s and universe’s secrets. But let’s say by some dumb luck we were to survive millennia as a species–even much much more. Let’s say we even manage to make leaps in our evolution, and unfathomable advances in our technology. Our species in the far FAR future, might surpass human limits and become more like aliens to us. Given this extremely vast period of time, could we eventually reach full knowledge?

I think that the reasoning behind the scientific method implicitly under-credits or denies our potential to eventually understand anything completely given enough time. (When I say “enough” time, I mean the most imaginative and implausible amount of time we could think of.)

Modern Family for those who want to know.  Anyways, we are in our early 30s, and the discussion of starting a family is frequently brought up.  The good news is that neither of us is pushing for either having children, or not having children - but it is something we think about from time to time.

Background here is that everything is great with us.  We are financially secure, own a house, both employed in positions that have longevity, I work from home so I’d be there for the domestic requirements... basically we have a lot of boxes checked to go down the route of having children - but we just aren’t sure about it.  

Anyways - it’s difficult getting honest information about what to expect when having a child from folks in our personal lives because “children are a blessing” and it’s the “greatest joy of life” is all we get from anyone we ask.  So I’m turning to you strangers on the interwebs where we can all express our honest opinions without fear of judgement from folks we care about.

So - I hear a lot about the joys of having children, but we are curious to hear the challenges from folks who have had kids.  

We aren’t aiming to make a decision anytime soon, for what it is worth - it just comes up in conversation sometimes, and we are both kind of frustrated with a lack of brute honesty on the topic.  Much appreciated, folks!"

Issues with testing, politics, etc. aside, we can measure the human cost in terms of positive tests, deaths and the economic cost in terms of GDP, unemployment numbers, stock market performance, etc. What is more difficult is measuring the human cost of the economic damage. 

We've run into this issue many times before - war vs. economic sanctions, environmental regulation vs. industry. An example that came to mind were the economic sanctions imposed on Venezuela, preventing access to potable water. Pumps, parts to repair water trucks, and other equipment can't be imported and real people die as a direct result of being cut off from that market.

The majority of those individuals will also become vegans. This is already apparent in today's society as the number of vegans in various countries has increased, some slightly, others drastically.  

From what I've seen online, many of these vegans believe that animal agriculture will quickly become a thing of the past. I'm inclined to believe them however I think we will continue to eat meat in the form of lab grown meat. 

Meat has become something that many people are used to eating and many, even upon learning about animal agriculture, the environmental affects, and the health benefits of plant based, are unwilling to give it up. This is why I think lab grown meat will be the future. While it most likely not do much to change your health it will eliminate animal agriculture and the negative environmental affects. This, in turn, allows people to feel less guilty about eating meat.

The price of producing lab grown meat has gone down considerably in recent years and the technology continues to improve and get well funded. I believe that we will see it come to stores across the first world in a few years. However I want to see your thoughts on this."

I'm not looking for judgement on my behavior, I'm just curious how common my situation is.

Last Sunday was Mother's Day in the United States. A few male friends and I were airing grievances about our mothers who share similar personality traits (which we perceive to be negative) last night. I think our Mothers would have been appalled to hear what we were saying as it was not particularly endearing given Mother's Day *just* happened. However, I was surprised to find how common our attitudes about our situations at large was. Among them

* All of us were quite frustrated by the lack of responsibility and accountability that our mothers hold for their own actions. It seems that each of them believe they are strongly indemnified against their poor life decisions which will potentially cost them quality of life in their impending elder life period. Any large financial mistakes or lifestyle choices which will result in handicapping in late life will be addressed in full by their kids.
   * I will say I have no problems supporting my mother in old age, but there seems to be an expectation that her children will have a turn key geriatric solution when the time comes that will not require anything on her part. Furthermore, she will hold no grudges against any one child that has made life decisions that ensure they're not capable of helping in the old age support period, as long as *one* of the kids does the job. (i.e. my sister can be prodigal and distant but still make it in the will)
* Each of our mothers have a strong belief in their skill as a parent and believe they did a great job in spite of the fact that we can each point to clearly subpar activity in our childhood.
   * Caveat: this is not to say any one of us think our mothers are exceptionally bad. It's just to say that our mothers seem to hold that they get an A- or an A for motherhood whereas we would argue they are somewhere in the C- to B+ range. Not bad, just not amazing either
* Our mothers felt that their motherhood has bought them a free pass for their character defects and rather tall demands and that it is unbecoming of us as their sons to challenge them on inappropriate behavior (e.g. rudeness in public, highly intolerant world views, demands for consistently visiting them, etc.) now that we are all adults. I don't consider my mother to be my friend as it feels like much more of a chore than a privilege to see her. 
* Each of us seemed confident that their passing would not take a strong emotional toll on us. One of use even went as far as to say, ""Life will be better for everyone when she's gone"" (keeping in mind that his mother doesn't do anything criminal and would not be described as a nuisance to society by almost anyone).
   * I will **absolutely** concede that this is total speculation on my part, and much like how no one knows how they will truly feel and react when they wield the power to end someone's life (for better or worse), I would be inclined to believe people who say ""I felt the same way until it happened, and so will you"".  It's not to say I don't love my mother, but I accept that our relationship is not a cornerstone in my life, and that her passing will be a relatively fleeting event all things considered. 

I will say, I don't believe any of our mothers would make the cut for r/insaneparents. It just surprised me that my outlook was not as uncommon as I believed. Thoughts?"

girnfq,To those that argue for the age of consent to sex to be drawn at 13-15: How would you argue against drawing the age of consent to sex at 18? Can you provide evidence showing that the age of consent to sex that is drawn at 18 is arbitrary and is worse than drawing the age of consent to sex at 13-15?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/girnfq/to_those_that_argue_for_the_age_of_consent_to_sex/,Economy-Swimmer,1,2020-05-13 12:11:45,4,/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/girnfq/to_those_that_argue_for_the_age_of_consent_to_sex/,NaN,"I need you to tell me what the issues with my current view are, and if there are any arguments against my view.

My current view is that the age of consent to sex that is drawn at 18 is not arbitrary and is better than drawing the age of consent to sex at e.g. 15. ""Arbitrary"" means that it is based on nothing, merely a whim. That is, someone decided on 17 ""just because."" That is objectively not the case, it is based on the age where we finish school and take on adult responsibilities due to a commonly agreed upon recognition of cognitive and emotional maturity. You cannot make the argument that it is arbitrary, since the word arbitrary means ""based on nothing"" and it is definitely not based on nothing. In other words, if it were literally arbitrary you would have to prove the age of consent could have just as easily been 56, 79, 2, or 30. If it were arbitrary there would be an equal chance of it being any age.

Also, the thing is that a line has to be drawn somewhere. Even within the US the age of consent to sex varies between 15-18. But because we *do* have to draw a line somewhere, we have to choose an age. Even if we were to say the age of consent to sex that is drawn ""at puberty"", kids hit puberty at different times. If someone hit puberty at 9, would it be okay for this 9-year-old to have sex?

The idea of the age of consent to sex is that at an age, you aren't mature enough to consent to sex. So if you asked a 10-year-old if they wanted sex and they said yes, you would still be a child molester, because at that age (even if the 10 year old hit puberty) the 10 year old is not emotionally mature enough to handle sex or understand it fully. As for when the age happens where people are ready for sex, it varies from person to person and the age of consent to sex that is drawn at 18 is better than drawing the age of consent to sex at for example 15 at the moment.

What are the issues with my view? How would you argue against drawing the age of consent to sex at 18? Can you provide evidence showing that the age of consent to sex that is drawn at 18 is arbitrary and is worse than drawing the age of consent to sex at 13-15?"

I am the manager of a restaurant, and we recently had this one girl quit unexpectedly.  She had been working with us for about a year.  It later came out to me that another girl who worked for us was bullying her, and caused her to quit.  I'm unsure about what to do, because a lot of what has happened between them occurred outside of the restaurant.  I'll call the girl who left (L) and the girl bulling her (B).

A few months ago, B was messaging L through an app we use for group messaging.  A manager would ask for a shift to be taken, and L would respond.  Then B would messaged L privately and say something like ""You don't know that position so you can't take it.""  When L told me about it, I asked to see the messages B was sending her.  They were all things like this.  There was nothing like name calling or obvious bullying.  If I read it in the tone of a teenage girl, I could probably see it coming off as catty or rude.  So I met with B.  I ended up suspending her from the app for a few months.  I told L that if she hears anything more from B, she needs to let me know.

Now a few months later, I didn't hear anything else.  The two worked fine on their shifts together as far as I could see.  Then she calls and tells me she quit, but didn't tell me why.  I thought it was odd.  A few days ago, some of the other teenage employees asked to meet with me.  They said that B had been bullying L so bad, that L started cutting herself.  Recently we had a person who worked for us up until last year die by suicide.  It was very troubling, and many of our employees knew them personally.   It's easy to see that this girl B could be pushing L down a similar path.

The hard part for me as a manager is that I haven't seen any of this happen at work.  What these girls told me though is that the bullying was very subtle.  When the two would work together, L would be talking to someone, and B would just be giving her a death state from across the room.  Or B would interrupt L when she would talk.  It's nothing I noticed, because B would always do what I ask and have a good attitude.  These girls also said when they try to work with B, she gives them attitude and doesn't listen.

So now I am in a tough position.  I trust these girls that brought this issue to my attention.  They wouldn't lie to me about something like this.  At the same time, it looks like most of this bullying is probably happening off of our property via social media or school.  I try to maintain a safe, happy, and friendly work environment, but I can only do so much.  As much as I've worked with B, she seems like a nice girl, but I have had quite a few people voice their concerns about her behavior when my back is turned.

So at what point should an employee be held responsible for bullying, even if most of it happens outside of work?  Can catty behavior such as sarcastic comments and mean looks be considered bullying in the workplace?  I remember being 16, and emotions can run really high sometimes, so even little things like that could get to me.  What do you all think?"

Mostly authorities have seen that going after the rich is risky and do it mostly only when they victimized their fellow rich like Bernard Madoff.  Basically if a ordinary person scheme , steal or do any violent crime can be prosecuted but executives and CEO in position in power can do crimes that can hurt like wage theft or cannibalize their company and ship most of the intensive   workforce part of the company in nations where is little or no ecological protections and workers live in near slavery conditions. we had scandals with food companies Like Nestle being involved with coffee and chocolate farms in Africa using children slavery. Public regulator have become unable to control companies like in last Boeing scandal and being reduced to their red tape lapdog. you have a big problem where companies have become so big and so powerful that they dictate conditions to states , consumers , workers and politicians . By example , the forming of monopolies in several markets like healthcare and Telecommunication with little intervention of states to control them and even giving them legal protection.

we are living in a society where white collar nepotism corruption and crimes are seen as usual action and where social and economic inequality are on the rise "" the rich get richer while the poor become poorer. the current epidemic have shown how most people are venerable economically due to current system and unchecked power of executives and the sense that politicians are not accountable anymore to  the people.

I'm obviously not a fan girl of the US government but at least they'd let me practice my religion freely in there country.

Power wielded by countries is decided by 2 factors : economy and military.

First we have got to get rid of this myth that the USA has the largest economy in the world, that is absolutely false. Its only the highest if you use nominal GDP the only reason in economics we have the nominal figure is literally to divide it by CPI, if you look at every other countries economics media such as sky news in the UK they never use nominal because that is just determined by exchange rates the Germans just pre-Hitler had the highest nominal in the world larger than the USA because of their hyper inflation even though america clearly had the biggest economy.  China's GDP ppp is astronomically higher than Americas its nearly as big as the next 2 countries combined and has been since 2011.GDP ppp is what you use to look at the size of an economy.

Now we will talk about military. This myth really grinds my gears when i hear : the USA spends more than the next blah blah countries combined' this is only true in nominal rates. When adjusted for ppp china's real military budget is around 500 billion hey the USA is still bigger you might say but lets break this down even more. When most people think 700 billion dollars on military they think 700 billion dollars of tanks,planes,artillery and such. Wrong! I'm sure most of you know about the 900 bases the us has abroad well believe it or not it costs a lot to maintain them add in the facts that USA's  troops are better paid than China's that leaves you with a total procurement of weapons budget of 150 billion dollars at its peak under Trump. China spends 41% of around 520 billion dollars on procurement which is around 220 billion dollars. China is catching up very quickly.

Next you might think their weapons are crappy compared to ours. That is a myth the Chinese are generally considered to have a very high tech well modernized army with equipment that is practically just as good. Hey isn't there equipment old soviet equipment well believe it or not the M1 Abrams was made in 1978 and its just been upgraded over time. The Chinese Mbt type 99 can definitely rival American M1. Its funny when you see these Reddit comment assuming that Chinese tech is going to be as crap as all the made in china manufacturing, they are probably unaware that china is the only country to have hyper sonic missiles and even the USA and Russia are trailing. But hey doesn't china just steal all our technology so they don't have any innovation base well America stole tech of the Wehrmacht after WW2 as the Germans had significantly more advanced equipment and secondly china graduates 4.5 times as many people as america in stem every year.

Oh and this is a final one, they think in a war that the USA could invade mainland China. Modern war games show that an invasion of mainland china would be pretty much impossible : to the west there is Kazakhstan,Uzbekistan and the Gobi desert, to the north the Russians and Mongolia, to the south weak neighbors, India wouldn't join as it doesn't have the logistics to move soldiers across the Himalayas. It would be a pacific war. Also in a war with popular mobilization we would see a WW2 situation where china would be able to produce more planes than America has people, for historical context in 1939 the us had an army smaller than Bulgaria while the Wehrmacht had the largest most tech advanced in the world that's why Hitler thought the USA would take until 1970 to catch up. And the china's army doesn't have experience well neither did America's before it rolled over the extremely experienced Iraq army in desert storm.

Right now i think the Americans have a more powerful army buts its delusion to think it will stay that way."

I want to help people understand their own minds and disorders so they can live a happy life.

I want to learn how simple things like hearing someone say they're thirsty makes you reach for your own drink without even noticing.

Or how helping someone uncover the root cause to some bad habits or insecurities. Like how i got stuck in a tree in a wind storm when a child so now I'm terrified of heights unless i have a handhold.

All in all, I want to learn about the hard physical science of the human brain and how it makes us who we are and how we can alter our own programming.

I want to do this so i can hopefully help humanity learn why we are the way we are; and ways to remedy bad habits, trauma, and give non-neurotypical people a fighting chance.

What degree/schooling fits this?

Thanks in advance for your time."

So there is a new disease, its not currently worldwide but localized study in the current ""hotspot"" says it is pretty contagious, although we have no idea how contagious at this stage. It presents almost no symptoms except, and here is the clincher, in \~50% of people infected it induces a permanent infertility, there is not enough data to accurately deduce how this 50% of people differ from the other 50% at this stage. Preliminary investigation in the hotspot has brought the following information which has been passed onto the relevant body for disease prevention although this is nothing more than educated guesswork: the disease is viral in nature, due to the warm climates in the hotspot it is thought to have some degree of heat resistance, its pretty contagious although its unknown to what extent. 

As this is a purely hypothetical discussion let us assume the validity of this model is watertight, this is not so much about the nature of the disease but the nature of government reaction. How would governments react? Would there be massive influx of funding for vaccines, studies and a possible cure? Would there be major studies about its ability to pass from host to host, how it effects patients differently, how it mutates, how it induces its one and only symptom? Or, given its lack of deadliness to its host would it be a more relaxed approach and take a back seat to other life threatening disease prevention? Would it be a case of skipping straight to a long process of finding a cure due to the nature of the disease?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: A new disease has been discovered that induces permanent infertility in 50% of the patients it infects, its contagious, heat resistant and viral in nature but we know very little about it other than that. How do government health organisations across the world react?"

Particularly bolstered by their incredible music which I'm bummed I didn't discover earlier.

Learning French will have no effect on my life (at least not in the environment I'm currently in) but as someone living in a country with 13 official languages and hundreds of regional variations of those languages, I know how much language affects the way people think and how many cultural doors open when you're able to hold a conversation in the mother tongue of the people from that culture. Which is why I'm picking new languages up- both Indian and Romance.

For those of you who speak at least 2 languages fluently, how much of an impact has it made on the way you think and perceive the world?"

Has this attitude led to an inability to critically self-reflect? In our desire to be best, we seem to forget the huge social issues our country has. We forget the frequent killings of black men by an institutionally racist police force and justice system. We forget the massacres in schools by young males who gain access to deadly firearms owing to poorly regulated gun laws. We forget the opioid crisis fuelled by big pharma companies that benefit from addiction. We forget the benefits of a universal healthcare system, instead preferring a rugged individualism which leaves behind the most vulnerable in our society. These issues keep on occurring, and there is outcry, but then nothing changes and we move on and forget.

I’m not saying America is not a great country, only that our need to be ‘the best’ leaves us unable to deliver change as this would amount to admitting that things currently are not perfect and that other countries do things better than us."

Just  to elaborate further on my question, I have heard it repeated many  times on the news by many different people that someday the student loan  bubble is going to burst because college tuition keeps increasing and  more and more people are going to college only to get jobs that didn't  need a degree to begin with. Many Economists are predicting a bubble  burst when all those underemployed graduates are no longer able to pay  back their student loans similar to the housing market crash of 2008.

Despite  the fact that guidance counsellors, family, friends and maybe society  as a whole ingrain the false notion that a degree is the only way to a  good job and good life, there is a small minority of ppl and employers  who are starting to challenge that idea. One I can think of is the tech  industry hiring people with no degree but plenty of coding projects  under their belts, but despite it seems that for the most part its  ""college or bust"". Like some districts rank their high schools based on  how many seniors went off to college and that number can impact their  funding.

I have heard some experts  say that since college graduates are a dime a dozen, wages will keep  stagnating, college will keep getting more expensive until we reach a  point where too many people default on their student loans. I have also  heard that maybe a crash like that is the shock therapy we need to stop  and think about whether or not a degree is worth it?

So  I honestly want to hear everyone's take on this whether you are an  economist, college student, college grad, or even if you never went to  college. What is going to happen after a lot of people realize that  college was not a good investment just like in 2008 with houses? Are we  gonna see more hiring managers go the way of tech companies and look for  something more meaningful than that ""piece of paper""."

My question is the title of this post, so you can ignore everything else, unless you would like some context behind why I'm asking it in the first place.  
If you liked Trump, you'll likely like four more years of him. If you never liked him, you certainly aren't going to like four more years of him.

I tried having faith initially, but the more I see, the more clear it is to me that the man is clearly not fit for the position that he's in. Twitter going so far as to stand up to him and his trigger happy Twitter finger says a lot about the things that he says, at least in my opinion. I saw a post somewhere - either Reddit or Twitter - of a tweet where he said something about a lack of leadership regarding the mayor of Minneapolis, which someone noted as ironic, considering he's the leader of the country.

A leader of a country complaining about a lack of leadership in a city in the country they're in charge of is basically an admission of their own failure, and from what I've observed over the last four years, there are many ways in which Trump has very much failed.

So, to the people who were once all for Trump, but now want nothing to do with him, what was it that finally broke you and made you think ""this man is an idiot, and I can't believe I liked him once""?"

I looked at the listing and it said it was out of stock, and that it will be in stock a few days from now, and the price went up.

So I checked the status of my order, and it says it’s shipped, and even completed a customs clearance process this morning, and there are new reviews on the listing from a few days ago. 

What would I do here in this situation, if I can even do anything? I contacted the seller yesterday and haven’t heard anything back yet. 

I guess I’m just wondering if I’m still going to receive my item? Or if I just have to wait it out a month, since it said shipping would take that long. I tried searching up things about it, but couldn’t find anything!

Any help is appreciated, thank you!"

I wore blackface to a birthday party when I was 19, a decade ago. I must have known it was not OK, because I washed it off at some point and carried on with the party. Regardless, I did it, potentially to be provocative or for attention.

Since then, I've learned how absolutely not OK it was. I feel terrible for all the hurt that such actions cause people on a daily basis, made all the worse by reducing years of prejudice to supposed 'entertainment'. I made light of real, historic violence that continues to harm people to this day. I did a terrible thing.

I committed an act of racism. Now, I campaign against racism in all forms, and acknowledge that I will never be a perfect ally but believe it's important to try to be one anyway.

What can I do to make up for this? Do I need to apologise to anyone, or make a social media post about it? Is it right for me to ask for all photos me at the party to be deleted, or is it important that they stay online?

Thanks for your genuine and helpful responses. I'll accept any and all criticism of what I did."

I'm a white, 31 year old male. My family is horribly ""southern racist"". They use the n-word with impunity (among other horrible slurs), then laugh at people (me) when I interject. They are the types of people who would beat my ass as a kid because my black friends would come over to play Legos. They punished me ""because black people steal"". I once wanted to do a middle school social studies project on civil rights, and they told me not to do it ""because I'm blessed to be white and not a n). I have been called everything from a n-sympathizer, to a n-lover, to a f\*g-lover. You name it, I've been called it. They believe white people hold dominion over others.

I have struggled with this for as long as I can remember. Over the last 4 or 5 years I have confronted this idea - when I love someone, I love all of them. The good and the bad. But racism/sexism/X-phobic is not bad, it's unacceptable. So to love them, means I accept the racist parts of them, and I DO NOT WANT TO. I teach at a very underrepresented school that is highly progressive and anti-racist; two things I strive to be myself. After some heated debates after I protested this weekend against police brutality and racism, I finally had enough. My mother told me I was an embarrassment, and that I could never handle the real-world. What she means by this, is I could not stand to live in complacency as a clean cut christian white racist boy. This disgusts her. I graduated top of my university, I have a Master's degree, and I am a USAF veteran. By all means I have accomplished many great things in my life, but I am an embarrassment to them. I have dreadlocks - this means I ""sympathize with N"" (whatever the fuck that actually means). People like me (anti-racist school teachers) are the problem with this country I was told recently. We don't know how to just shut up and let white people run the world. They truly believe that POC are inferior to them, and people like me (normal, NOT FUCKING RACIST people) are the problem; we want to disrupt the system. Yes. Yes we do. So I am moving to another state next month, because I took an AMAZING job with Teach For America, and I'm ready to leave all of this behind. I can't deal with them anymore. It's been 15 years I have actively hurt in my heart because I don't like the person I have to become to get their approval. 

I have come to realize that racism is racism, and it doesn't matter if blood binds you. My family is toxic and I have chosen to break the cycle. I despise them for so many things they have done throughout my life. You cannot have a conversation with them, they are so ignorant (and FUCKING MEAN), that they will flip it back around and call me an ""educated liberal pussy"". They live in misery. Always depressed and think everyone is out to harm them (thanks Fox News). So once my mom told me all those horrible things a few days ago, I basically said goodbye. For good. I can no longer passively ""love"" their horrible, old-world ways. I cannot listen to one more reason of ""I was raised this way"", or ""it's just my belief"" or ""Agree to disagree"". We agree to disagree on which type of pie tastes best, not on who's lives matter because of skin color. There is no place in the future for that way of thinking. I cannot bring that shit with me to my next chapter. I feel so free knowing that I'm done. I'm done passively condoning their horrible ways. 

Am I the only person who has ever done this? I need advice! They are destroying my happiness, because I HATE the person I have to become around them - a silent, nodding, obedient boy who know's nothing of the world."

Despite the feeling as if this could be a turning point for police reform with the events leading up to the unrest and the pandemic exposing the shortcomings of the US government, I have noticed a few things. 

Firstly, it seems that the police are a lot more aggressive. This may be due to the pandemic but I believe it's trickled down from the attitude of leaders like Trump. 

Secondly, the lack of organized protesting, with specific demands and leaders who can be the faces of the movement. Additionally, more tactics should be taken and used. More aggressive tactics like sabotaging police logistics, using tactics like paint to blind police wearing helmets/masks, umbrellas to block tear gas, and laser pens (like other protests of Hong Kong) should be more wildly used. Other leaceful demonstration tactics such as boycotts, sit-ins, and using anthem songs (like with the non-violent protestors of the 60's Civil Rights Movement) can also be used to boost popularity of the cause with the public and also since many demonstrators are probably not wanting to be seen by the media as rioters or potentially be arrested. 

Lastly, even though social media has its benefits of spreading information and showing real-time news, the lack of people who have actual membership/affiliation with organized activist groups doesn't seem sustainable. It's easy to forget when you don't meet regularly with many others or an organized group to push for a cause.

Even with all the energy and buzz today, will the George Floyd Protests invevitably amount to nothing? Being a little older now and the more I learn about previous protests/revolutions, it seems like this  is panning out the same as previous movements like Ferguson, Trayvon Martin (maybe we can identify all these as Black Lives Matter movement) from the past several years and The Occupy Movement from a decade ago. Would be interested in hearing others thoughts."

I was friends with this guy for around two years back in high school in 2016 and 2017. Since then we’ve been out of touch until around a couple of months ago he hit me up. We even hung out irl and had a chat It was good to catch chat with him, and I was surprised to hear that he recently got diagnosed with Bipolar.. He was honestly pretty normal in High School so I was shocked to hear this. He was pretty normal back in high school, but it’s very possible his Bipolar stems from his dads anger management issues and he constantly takes it out on his son, but we will never know 100% what the reason is as it’s guessing with mental illness.

He’s come off his medication and he is on a complete high, grandeur sense of self type of thing that people with Bipolar experience. He constantly spams me message upon message every single day telling me every detail about his life and how he has discovered the meaning to success and all these crazy realisations. It’s just so much to deal with and it completely drains my energy as I do care about him but I have my own problems to deal with too..

I’ve asked him to please just stop spamming me and message less, I’ve tried nicely telling him he needs to find the right medication so he can just chill out (as he didn’t like the other one) and every time he asks for advice I try tell him what he should do but he just never listens, I think he just talks to me as someone to vent to.

Every time he messages me it puts me in such a negative mood.

It’s not only this but he also spams my other friend Sean constantly and it’s gotten out of hand, what should I do about this? I’ve honestly considered just blocking him and not talking to him ever again because it drains so much from me emotionally because I need to deal with myself.. but I also don’t want to be a dickhead friend.. what should I do?"

Counter intuitively this will radically decrease Western hegemony and increase China's as they will focus on domestic markets which will allow them to escape the middle income trap and become a self sufficient economy based on domestic consumption/services. Also in addition to that factor in that because of the decoupling from China manufacturing will move to India and Africa and because China isn't exporting as much countries can support their own domestic companies by putting tariffs on as it wont be uneconomical after industrializing which tl;dr means they will basically bulldoze through the middle income trap. This will essentially mean a countries power ranking will be based off of population when everyone has a roundabout similar GDP per ca pita which will make China/India first and The USA and the largest Muslim majority countries fighting for 3rd with south American, SEA and parts of Africa dominating 1-20 with European countries relegated to 20-30. Is this finally the end of Western dominance over the world?

In my opinion i think the true golden age of the west began in 18 June 1815 with the defeat of Napoleon. This is because until WW1 there was the great power games where one country couldn't be that powerful over the other which allowed industrialization,scientific research and of course colonialism. In WW1 Europe definitely took a massive hit to the new world superpower the US and after WW2 other than the USSR military there was no economy that could compete with the US. Post the fall of the Soviets the US enjoyed complete dominance over the world and power projection the Romans could only dream of crushing the 4th largest army in the world nonchalantly and crushing the economy of the former state that stood a chance against them using sanctions however there was something lurking in the background something which the West itself created : globalization.  The initial projections for China was that by 2050 at earliest they should be done industrializing however they did it by 2011. Whatever the USA did to industrialize they used the same methods but with modern technology and they showed as time goes on the process for industrialization gets quicker meaning by 2025 most countries should be bulldozing the middle income trap. As Kaplan says in his book this has been an anomaly in world history and the concentration of power should go from the Atlantic back to the Indian ocean in the future

So do you think the golden age of the west is over reigning from 1820-2020 the end of which was speed the hell up by coivid-19.

It's all about death threats and talking about how I should be raped. My ex and I broke up few months prior to that and I still haven't moved on because it was my first relationship. I had been having anxiety attacks in school and turned to my friends for support. I wanted to die, planned things ahead but I still couldn't do it because I didn't have the courage and was so scared.

I was never really diagnosed clinical depression but I knew something was wrong with me, I didn't have support at home and some of my friends were always making fun of me due to my appearance or they just didn't like me. Without emotional support from family and friends, I relied on myself to get better. I talked to counsellors, teachers and distracted myself on other things that made me have more confidence.

Everything was finally getting better. Then I found out one friend in my group, we'll call her **Jess (not her real name)** was flirting with my ex and I thought I should talk to her about it and tell her how it hurt me. She apologised and we became more close than ever. We were doing everything together along with our other friends such as sleeping over, eating out, partying, doing creative things, etc. We always comforted each other and knew almost everything about one another since we have so many things in common like ethnicity, creativity, shared traumas and a lot of other things. In short, I treated her like a sister.

Fast forward to 2017 when I suddenly received a message on Instagram from my ex, saying things like ""I hope you die"", ""I will rape you"" or ""You will be raped one day"" and a lot of nasty things. I was miserable and had so much anxiety from it. I told my friends and showed them the message in which they comforted me and were always there to support me. They told me to go to the police so I eventually reported him after a series of messages. The police helped me, they investigated, came to school to talk to him and he adamantly denied it. **Jess was always there for me, she consoled me, provided me emotional support and even told me she will punch my ex for being disgustingly horrible.**

No one understood my pain and suffering. I had to live through it alone. I decided to leave the country and stay in my home country to heal myself. The police took couple of months to trace the source location using IP address. **They located Jess's home address and informed me. All this time, she had been sending those death threats behind my back and made a fake account using my ex's name, while also comforting me.** I couldn't believe it at first and I was in complete distress. I told the police that I didn't want to get her in trouble and just entirely cut her off from my life including social media.

In those 3 years, I couldn't move on from the pain. Depression really sucked the life out of me. I tried studying again and was able go about my life as if nothing happened. But I still want to die. The impact it caused me was huge. It cost me my relationships with other people such as with my family and other friends. It left an empty void in my heart that no one could ever understand. On top of that, I was also dealing with so much insecurities and self-hatred.

The other night, I was having a mental breakdown and hurt myself even more by I stalking her account using my other account that she didn't block. She looked so happy and well. I envy her. While here I am, suffering in despair. She spent the last 3 years not knowing how I felt. I didn't talk to her at all after knowing what she did. My other friends also lost contact with her. As years went by, my grudge and hatred towards her grew even more. **I guess karma doesn't exist. I never found out why she did those things. Did she envy me? Why did she hate me? We did everything together but she secretly loathed me. I need advice. Please. What do I do? Do I message her as a closure to tell her how I feel and ask for answers? Or be silent forever?**"

At this point I just want to have as much information on the situation and base my opinion on that. Hopefully some of you can help me formulate my opinions a little better.

First off I want to say that the only thing I am 100% in agreement with is that the officers involved with the arrest of George Floyd were in the wrong. They are responsible for his death and should be held accountable. Where I get fuzzy on is how I feel about the police and the protesters. Let me go ahead and give some points that are on my mind.

I support the police. I think they have an important job to fulfill. Are there bad apples? Of course, just like any other profession. I've been watching a lot of videos on youtube of people who are/were police officers, and it's helped me really humanize them. They explain why police do things the way they do and why headlines can be misleading if you read them at face value. For example, a headline reading ""Unarmed Black Man Shot by Police,"" might be technically true, but you have to look into the details. For example, there is a black man in a car. Police have detained him and are trying to get him out of the car multiple times. He doesn't listen, and then runs from the police. They chase him where his car crashes into a tree. The police surround him with guns drawn and yell commands for him to show them his hands. He gets out of the car and is turned sideways at the officers so you can't see his right side. They yell for him to show them his hands multiple times but he doesn't listen. Then he suddenly jerks his hands forward in what looks like a shooting stance, and the officers shoot. He didn't have a weapon, so he was technically an ""unarmed black man,"" but the context matters more. He had multiple chances to give up and not get shot, but in the end I think that shooting was 100% justified. That's one example of a video I've seen, but I have seen a lot more like that. There are some videos like the George Floyd incident that go the other way, where no amount of context can justify an officer's actions as well. Still, I want to try to find the hidden context in each article or video to make my decision. With that kind of thinking in mind, here is where I stand on the protests.

First, I don't understand why the police would choose to be aggressive for no reason. They are under such heavy scrutiny, and they know they will be filmed anywhere the protests are going on. I think there has got to be a reason why the police are shooting people with rubber bullets and using tear gas. It's definitely a lose/lose situation for the police and protesters, but I think it's necessary. Here is how I run things through my head.

1. I see huge crowds of people blocking streets and congesting small areas. It seems rather unorganized to me. I think no matter the context, blocking the roads so emergency vehicles and traffic can not get though is wrong. In this case, police use of force is justified for moving people off the road using tear gas or whatever. There was a protest march the other day in my town where I saw a large crowd marching down sidewalks. A few of my coworkers went to it, and said there was no police brutality or anything. That makes sense to me because they were obeying the laws and not blocking streets.
2. The crowds are also unruly. If you have hundreds of people yelling curses and insults at you, it will put you on edge. If I was one of a few dozen officers vs. a crowd of a hundred, I would be scared. If the crowd looks unruly and is looking aggressive as if they will snap at any moment and come kill you, then I think it is reasonable to use force to pacify the crowd. Even if the protesters are technically ""peaceful,"" as in not being destructive or violent, their behavior is kind of a red flag of what could happen. Same way in videos where you have some suspect acting erratically and aggressive, that officer has to put his safety above the safety of that suspect, because if he gets killed, that suspect now has his gun. As above, the protest that happened in my town was just a bunch of people on the sidewalk holding signs, and they didn't seem to get hassled by police.
3. I've seen videos of ""innocent"" people getting hurt by police. People who were news or maybe just a random person driving by. Here is my thought. If you are in proximity to a protest that checks the above two points, then I think you are able to get lumped into that group. The police will view you as another potentially violent protester and act accordingly. One thing I am unsure of is if a random passerby could get caught up in a mess unknowingly. There is a video going around where a man was driving his pregnant wife, and he got tear gas fired at him. I wonder the context of that video leading up to the whole filming. If I saw a bunch of people in the streets or something, I would go around. I would take another way. The best way to avoid getting hurt is to just not be there and leave.

So in summary, I think that the way some protesters conduct themselves is triggering the police use of force. It's a lose/lose situation. Even if the crowds are technically ""peaceful"" and have no intention of violence, the fact that an unruly mob of people are blocking streets is enough to warrant force to get them to disperse. If they went about it another way, I don't think there would be issues.

Thanks for reading everyone. I'm hoping to have some nice discussions with you all to help change my opinions."

I just want to create a discussion on the current riot in America, which, to me, is absurd, considering the amount of looting and vandalism going on in the name of ""justice for black people"". 

1. I have been doing some research, and I struck me how ""bad"" black people are, statistically. [According to this](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-43), black people have committed more crime than white people, considering black people only accounts for 12,1% of the population of the US, while white people accounts for 72% of the population, yet the arrested crime rate of the two races are approximately equal. Specifically, 5 out of 100 black people were arrested for larceny theft, while only 2 out of 100 white people were for the same reason. Same goes for robbery, 10 out of 100 for black with only 1 out of 100 for white. Lower population but higher crime rate.
2. [Interracial killings in the USA statisics.](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/race-and-homicide-in-america-by-the-numbers) There are more white people killed by blacks than blacks killed by whites in general. Homicides committed by blacks on whites reached nearly 600 cases in 2007, and fluctuates between 400 and 600 in a span of 16 years, while blacks slain by whites only peaks at 200 cases. It's the pattern that I have pointed out in my first argument: lower population but higher crime rate. [Most](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_6_murder_race_and_sex_of_vicitm_by_race_and_sex_of_offender_2013.xls) blacks were killed by black people (probably gang wars).
3. I'm being a little bit subjective here, but my friends who traveled to the US and settled there, told me stories of how the white communities advised them to stay from the black people, for it is the ideal place for crime to flourish. Not all, but many, many of them generally lives a messy lives, they don't keep their neighborhood clean, usually plays rap at high volumes into the night (my friend lives in Baltimore). Black people were born into the mindset of them being the outcast and live accordingly. They play the victim and don't even work, but expect to be paid. Taxes from whites are extracted to aid those who play too hard but don't work hard enough (talking of Obama aid). I think that is one of the main reasons that create the division between blacks and whites. 
4. 28 years ago, 1992, LA, [Rodney King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King) was a victim of police brutality, whose case then spurred a similar protest to the current one in 2020. It quickly escalated into a riot, with thousands of people injured, killed, houses burned, shops broken into. Those blacks even robbed shops owned by BLACK PEOPLE. I am not for police brutality, but robbing people in the name of justice?"

In the 1900s they protested for equal rights to great success, but they had an end goal of equal rights. Rights is a controllable thing by the government, and can be enforced. As far as I can tell (and correct me if I am wrong please) the protests are because people don't like racism. Racism is not a controllable variable; it is how one individual feels about something. You can't change how someone feels, juat as they can't change how you feel. Racism is illegal as far as discrimination is concerned, and if there is a problem with that then it can be reported and dealt with. But Jim Bob on the street not liking people because of the color of there skin is not a controllable thing other than adopting a big brother system. 

So, I repeat my question: what is the end goal for all the protesting and/or rioting?

(This is a serious question, and no I'm not racist. I just do not understand what people are trying to actually accomplish)"

**heres a quick example of sovling porbelms creatively:**

* before the laundry machine was invented, a big kind of a problem was girls didnt have much free time to do anything like develop hobbies or run for ceo prime minster president director aircraft engineering etc
* i dont know the history of the invention of laundry machine but automating this process of cleaning clothes  in total saved time for ppl in general
* this was a way of solving a problem that nobody thought about
* creatively = outside of what is the norm at any given point in time

in happy longterm relationships, what resulting qualities or skills are more valuable than learning how to solve problems creatively?

for example say the couple had the quality of cooperation, the question is why does that quality matter and what does it lead to? cooperation along with otehr qualities would lead to creative problem solving

* the end result of what things lead \[to\] is what are    **resulting qualities or skills**
* i cant think of a better phrase atm
* see [https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/asmvxc/til\_a\_harvard\_study\_found\_that\_hiring\_one\_highly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/asmvxc/til_a_harvard_study_found_that_hiring_one_highly/)

&amp;#x200B;

other possible options i thoguht about for things that are more important than solving problems creatively are:

* **being open**\- being to new thoughts, and new ideas (that are based on good evidence and reason ofc), but thinking about it, this actually is just one of the many prerequisites to being able to solve problems creatively
* **loving the ideals &amp; going towards the ideals**\- even if a couple had this if they didnt know how to solve porbelms creativly i dont see how this would be more important than solving porbelms creativly
* **initiative in starting new things**\- showing leadership stuff like that, umm i dont where i would place this in what is valuable, but its def not  more important than solving porbelms creativly
   * but maybe it actually is more importnt tho gotta tink abojt this one
* **compromise**\- ok this is really bad, and this is a large reason why solving porbelms creaitlvey is so much better
   * compromise = to give up something you care about and/or selfish about
   * compromise is really bad cos its \[not\] creating more value or more wealth in society, for example there's 1 pizza, to compromise theere's still gonna be 1 pizza at the end no matter, well i guess there'll be no pizza which is worst
   * or rent, landowners that rent from residents arent creating any extra value, the value is still the same at the end usually.
      * same goes the residents, they arent imporoving they arent making anything better
* **being thoughtful-** i dunn o what this word means its too vague and i dont know hwo to descibe it using words so there's no way to compare and see it was more important than being able to solve problems creatively cos i dun even know wat this means to be 'thoughtful'
* etc other things somewhere... duno where i put them..  cant think of anything else off top of mind atm

It is sadly as old as this country's history. Yet, somehow this time White America seems to be responding differently than before. Much more solidarity and much less dismissiveness.

&amp;nbsp;

I can remember the time in my life when I heard of Trayvon Martin
because that was the first time in my life I had ever experienced living through such a high-profile case of an innocent person of color being unjustly killed. The public outcry seemed so loud that I thought something meaningful would surely change for the better as result of his death. Instead, we saw the pleas for systemic change ignored.

&amp;nbsp;

In the nearly-a-decade's worth of time since then, I can hardly remember the precise moments of my life when I first heard about the seemingly endless barrage of unjust killings of Black Americans. There seems to be so many, and each time the response is the same: death &gt; a gentle slap on the wrist (if that) &gt; requests for change &gt; crickets.

&amp;nbsp;

So when I first heard about Ahmaud Arbery, Christian Cooper, and George Floyd my response was naturally one of a fleeting moment of sadness and then one of suppression, hoping never to think about them again. Anything other than this kind of jaded response just results in much more pain when the same seemingly inevitable outcome is reached once again. I've effectively been conditioned into having an apathetic response anytime one of these incidents makes the news.

&amp;nbsp;

To my surprise, everyone seems to be listening now. Everyone seems to be paying attention. I certainly welcome this change in response from the public, particularly from White America. But why this sudden change in tone? What makes this case different from all the rest? I don't understand it.

&amp;nbsp;

In my view, tragic and gruesome as it may be, the killing of George Floyd is one on a far-too-long list of other innocent people being killed by police. What is making this point in history so unique?

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: Added spacing for readability, and spelling.

Edit: A brief summary of some of the responses that have stood out to me:

* u/Laurelwoodsong Nothing particularly special. The perfect storm of the right place, the right time, and the right publicity.
* u/winiray A phenomenon called 'the tipping point'.
* Younger generations having grown old enough to have a greater proportion of their voices heard.
* The sheer horrificness of the murder of George Floyd with indisputable video evidence.
* The response of more police violence toward people of all races at protests against police violence.
* A disruption of normalcy due to the pandemic, facilitating the ability of pent-up anger to be heard."

A Gendarmerie is defined as: A **gendarmerie** or **gendarmery** is a military force with law enforcement duties among the civilian population.

For example, the most notable one, the French Gendarmerie is tasked with areas of responsibility like smaller towns, rural and suburban areas, counter insurgency operations and riot control.

The closets the USA has could be the USCG and the Boded patrol. Merging the two and expanding its missions to fulfil land based operations **could** take a heavy load from local police forces and could let them do community policing and form bonds with the people they protect letting the gendarmerie deal with riots and heavy crime.

This could also end with the militarisation of local police forces since it being a national paramilitary force, heavy crime could be dealt with accordingly to the need to act basis, so no small local police would need an MRAP.

What's your opinion? Would it be constitutionally legal?"

Wouldn't that mean the real money that was circulated in the economy will still remain stagnant, people's income did not actually rise faster than productivity, and that the bubble will just result in an arbitrary growing wealth gap that wouldn't have any real consequences until the rich decides to spend them?"

For context, he is half black &amp; half white, and works in a career that is deemed to be ""lesser"" but has made a substantial amount of money to the point where is able to buy cars, houses, jewelry, clothing, etc. without a second thought. He is also very well respected in and out of his career. He is also not from wealth whatsoever.  

I said that he is privileged-- he said that he is not and has worked hard to live his life. The only way he would say he is privileged is when he works up to his wealthier clients status' (who are POC, btw) aka having TOTAL financial freedom. He also does not acknowledge the advantages that he has over the circle of friends that are not as fortunate than him. 

Basically, I am saying that yes, he was not born into privilege but he has worked hard enough to gain those privileges, aka he is privileged now with his lifestyle.  I pulled up a socioeconomic checklist and he checks almost all of them in regards to wealth and the advantages coming from that. However,  I've done my research now and I see a lot of definitions around the word 'privilege' and that it is unearned. Am I wrong to say that he is privileged because his wealth was not given to them? If I am, what is a better way to say that yes you have worked hard but you have advantages over others because you have worked to get to that point?

Also, he does not think he is wealthy because he compares himself to his wealthier clients when he absolutely has disposable income and access to things that ""normal people"" would never have. I still think he's delusional in that sort of sense but I want to see if I was wrong before I even address that."

That in and of itself is great and noble to stand up to injustice but I can't help but wonder that it's not very practical to deal with the root cause, since those who dont' belong might feel excluded even when they suffer the same abuse and as a result it might be perpetuated against them for longer. The support for those people might be in some cases no more than empty words without any real follow through. So why do many reject the idea of standing to the principle rather than try to link it to a specific group ? for example instead of standing up for BLM, you instead stand up against Police brutality in general regardless the victim's colour. Then the image becomes a unified front against the horrendous practice and that you cant abuse your power against white people, latinos, asians etc because you would get just as much backlash as you would from BLM if you assaulted a black person

In essence it's the ""all lives matter"" applied in practical reality rather than only being used as anti BLM slogan."

One example is gardening in the backyard in hot humid weather. Sometimes there were many mosquitoes and I had to wear long pants and a net. Other times it was in weird positions, like weeding under bushes, or having to squeeze through bird netting to pick fruit. All of that was okay and overall those count as good times. It's not like I was getting some direct pleasure simultaneously, because the fruits of those labours were enjoyed later. At other times in my life just being outside in hot humid weather would have been a bad experience.

Another example is hiking long distances in a beautiful location I like with sore muscles, and actually kind of enjoying the pain.

I've felt far more bothersome discomfort comfortably sitting in school waiting for a class to end. 

Is psychological discomfort more intense generally? I'm not convinced that this is always the case. Does physical discomfort become insignificant when I experience a sense of meaning in what I'm doing?"

I'm a nerd, so this is coming from that kind of perspective.  It could be anything from a game, tv show, anime, club, or whatever.  

&amp;#x200B;

For me, I was really into this one board game.  They had a bunch of cool miniatures that you could paint and play with.  They had a few Kickstarters to help make the game happen.  I collected EVERYTHING for this game and was super happy.  Then they did one more Kickstarter, and they ran into funding problems.  My guess is they expanded too quickly with the success of their company, and they lost all the money.  It's been 5 years, and I still haven't seen any of my $500 that I spent on the Kickstarter.  

&amp;#x200B;

As you could imagine, the community turned toxic.  I was a big part of their forums, sharing pictures of my painted miniatures as well as engaging in conversations.  I wanted to do more for the community, such as help with playtesting and creating custom content.  After the Kickstarter turmoil, my love of the game just tanked.  I couldn't even stand to look at my entire painted collection anymore.  

&amp;#x200B;

It caused me a great deal of depression.  I eventually decided it wasn't worth it anymore and sold it all.  I have since reinvested that money into other games to fill the void, but I still regret what I did.  I let the few toxic voices get to me and just killed my enjoyment of the game.  I should have been happy with what I had, but because the company pretty much went bankrupt and people were angry, I couldn't enjoy the product anymore.  I was desperate to get it back, so I even found someone selling almost everything I had unpainted on ebay.  I bought it all back.  I was content for awhile, but then the nagging sensation got to me again.  I sold it again.  I told myself I'll never go back... but here I am longing for what I once had and feeling stupid for selling it in the first place.  

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, there isn't much of a community or anything for the game anymore.  No official forums or facebook.  The company is still making things, but they haven't really made a dent in what was promised in that Kickstarter 5 years ago.

On the other side of the spectrum the Republican 'deep state'/establishment  was pretty much destroyed by Trump in 2016 and another Mitt Romney/paul ryan esq candidate is highly unlikely to win a Republican primary.This is also why you see alot of establishment Republicans endorsing Biden . One of the relevant parts of their policies is isolationism like the North Korea move, telling NATO to pull its weight and isolating allies like Canada and the EU due to tariffs(something which the Berniecrats agree with them on)as well as making peace with the Taliban. 

Seeing as returning to isolationism/not interventionsm is the forward momentum for both parties what do you think the geopolitical effects are going to be and is China,Russia or even an emerging India going to snap up the former role of the US in the geopolitical world stage a stage in which the American people seem to be getting more tired of everyday."

And I started to wonder if we treat racial harassment differently than sexual harassment. I think while different, they're quite similar in a way that they cause distress in the target party.

KKK rallies are a good example where the freedom of speech protects them, but if they had a, ""rape rally,"" I'm not sure if we would treat it the same way.  


I think that free speech should be protected unless when its core idea is to directly harm others. How do we draw the line if we're to legally indict someone for racism? Do we treat it differently than sexual assaults or sexism and if so, why?"

My fiance and I have been together for 4 years and every time we fight he calls me his ex's name or tells me I act like her. Even when he is completely in the fucking wrong. For example, he quit his job going on 2 weeks ago. I've been trying to be patient and not push him to find a new one because last time this happened it didn't end well. He also is a heavy cigarette smoker and drinks alcohol every day it seems like. I pointed out in an argument we had that besides all the other reasons not to smoke a cancer stick,being jobless with no income seems like a perfect opportunity to quit smoking since I will not buy them for him. This as you can imagine lead to an explosive argument where he said ""it's bitches like you and *ex name* always acting crazy af."" Then he left to you guessed it go to the liquor store. I am so sick of being called crazy and constantly being compared to an ex that is nothing like me because I work my ass off for everything I have instead of collecting government money and sitting on my ass. It makes me feel like I really am crazy. Is a relationship like this even worth it? I love him,I really do want to marry him but fuck I'm at my breaking point here."

People fail all the time due to legitimate reasons: systemic injustice, other people's actions, accidents, and so on. Sure, there *are* people who undergo that and *still* succeed, but how many of them compared to those who failed? In fact according to researches, social mobility is going down throughout the years, for example. By making people's default assumption that failure is because the person him/herself is to blame, it erodes empathy and the awareness that the world simply isn't as just nor meritocratic as the quotes put it to be.

Years of asking ""how in the hell did she manage this?"" has led me to this point. I've learned that most of her computer time is used to watch funny videos that her friends send her as attachments to emails that have so many ""FWD""s in the subject line that the actual subject is pushed well out of view.

Once upon a time, when the internet was less mature, email was the most accessible content-sharing protocol for most people. Old people took well to it since the parallel between snailmail and email made it easy for them to understand. Now though, we have much more sophisticated, and arguably more straight-forward mechanisms for sharing content, especially video. Everyone knows what YouTube is, and everyone knows how to share a link. So why does this insanely convoluted method of video sharing persist among the senior population? I'm putting this to reddit because the old people I have asked have all become defensive, assuming I'm attacking them for their preferred way of doing things. At this point I don't care about convincing anyone to do things the ""proper way"". That ship sailed a long time ago. I just sincerely want to know how this is still happening in 2020.

In order to rip a video from a web player, one would need to have specialised software to perform the task, feed the video link to one of the many YouTube downloading sites, install a browser plugin, or go digging around in the site sources in developer options to find the direct link to the video file. While none of these options take a huge amount of know-how, they *are* more complex than grabbing the link and pasting it into the body of an email, or using the 'share' options under the player.

Someone is going to the effort of downloading YouTube content, transcoding it to fit the filesize restrictions of most mail servers, and attaching it. Usually as an outdated format such as MOV or AVI. I need to know why this happens. Can anyone provide any insight?"

so what is the difference between an failed state and effective one ?

\-representatives and leaders that actually represent their people and their interest and is accountable to them. in this area , lobbyist and personnel interest usually take precedent on people needs. and Corporation have a strangle hold on many politicians from both parties that even some suggested that US is a corporatocracy.  when people representatives are more concerned to fill their bank account then to serve the public then you have serious problem of corruption and decadence. 

\- a measure of meritocracy and a good social net to help citizen usually define a good democracy. Us had problems with minorities (in fairness most country with slavery past has this problem like Brazil and south Africa). in US , you have a really big problem of allocation of resources with companies profiting from globalization of trade while most people had stagnant wages and living conditions.

\- a effective country would have an independent Judiciary and press. both are under siege in present presidency. 

- a good middle class as well a good education system that insure critical thinking to electorate are a good sign for a democratic society. In US , we are seeing an impoverished population with more and more living from Pay check to pay check and education cost s rising . A population crushed by debt and economic servitude have a harder time to defend it's rights. 

\-usually in failed state you have a privileged minority that have more rights and wealth then the rest of the population  and would represent the autocrat base of support. in US , two categories could fill this description police and executives and companies with both having  an habit of  evading serious repercussion to their actions.

\-another sign of good health for a country is a thriving competitive economy . in this detail , US is failing with state protected monopolies in Healthcare , insurance and telecommunication which make life harder and more expensive to people while enriching a few .

\-Tribalism is a another dangerous sign of failing state where you consider the other parties as enemies and not as partner . and also loyalty to your party leader whatever he do. dividing and discriminating  people between ethnicity and culture is a way used by autocrat to remain in power and gain support.

your opinion ?

When you adjust military budgets for this China real military budget almost matches the US and less look at this more close the US spends a shit ton on salaries,pensions and healthcare for veterans plus those 900 military bases don't pay for themselves. 700 billion isn't spent on shiny new jets only around 150 billion is spent on procurement of weaponry china spends on the other hand spends nearly 250 billion on procurement, that is almost a factor of 2 China military in all but naval forces is set to overtake the USA in terms of tech and weaponry by 2030 its navy between 2049 and 2060. A navy is that last thing to build up as the maintenance cost are too high and it just isn't efficient when you also factor in the infamous cost disease the USA suffers from eg inefficiency and wasteful spending by the DOD it looks even bleaker. China also skipped 40 years of r and d and trillions by hacking US 5th gen designs and also Chinese engineers have shown they can innovate really well in fact up to 1/3 of STEM output is done by Chinese nationals. The myth of the US spending more than the next million countries combined needs to die out!"

Masks can help prevent not only the spreading of COVID-19, but also other contagious viruses like the flu, which kill 10s of thousands every year. On top of this,  if new diseases were to arise, it would probably help stop the spread of them before we even knew about them. Personally I don’t really like masks, personally they make it hard to breathe and I feel like people are a lot more distant with them on because they can’t read stuff like facial cues, but it’s not my place to say whether or not we should wear them or not, and this may be seen as a wake up call to prevent the spread of disease in general.

A colleague of mine at university told me a piece of gossip regarding another colleague (that she was secretly dating some guy). Honestly i didnt care much because it's someone else's life and i didnt really need to know who was dating whom. But anyway she repeatedly asked me not to tell anyone about it.

About 3 months later my best friend told me the same secret while we were just chatting. The girl who was dating the guy has told her (She was gradually telling people that she was dating, and it was not a secret anymore. So my best friend had no reason to keep it a secret) So i told my best friend that i already knew because my colleague told me. I usually discuss things with her as she's very trustworthy.

Yesterday suddenly my colleague asked me whether i told anyone about the secret. I told her that i didnt. But that my best friend told me first and then i told her that ""i already knew because you told me"" Then she was furious! She said ""i trusted you, how could you? I feel stupid for telling you. Why did you do that?"" I apologized and said that it wont happen again. I told her i didnt reveal the secret but that i'm sorry for revealing her name. I felt so bad because it was a slip of the tounge. Now she won't forgive me. And this is not a secret anymore because the girl and the guy have already told many people. I think this colleague might have heard it from someone else and thought i revealed it.

I feel hurt because she's putting all the blame on me. I mean she couldn't wait to gossip about the secret as soon as she found out and now she's shouting at me! I'm not even her good friend and she still decided to gossip about someone else's personal life with me. She's just angry because she got caught gossiping. A part of me is sad because she won't trust me anymore. But another part is glad because now i wont have to hear her useless gossip anymore. This colleague has told me several other secrets and i have kept them well. It hurts more because of this.

Do i deserve all this blame?"

I believe he has fallen into the many traps that officers can find themselves in and I am curious to know if you have experienced some of the same things.

He holds his 5 children to much higher standards that are impossible to meet. We are not allowed to mess up for any reason that would make people question his parenting or his position as a police officer. he would immediately make us feel guilty by saying “that’s embarrassing for me! How does that make me look as a cop!?” He has also threatened to get other police officers to come over and talk to is about our behaviors to try to scare us. It is as if we are extensions of him and we are not allowed to be our own person.

His entire identity is based off his profession. I have never thought very highly of his position and tended to ignore the conversations about police officers. I did not appreciate when he brought his work identity home with him. His only friends are people from the force. He came home from a shift and immediately watched cop shows and trump videos to which I left to go to my room. This caused us to grow even more distant as I did not praise him or give into praising the profession. He needed constant validation from his family which I did not care to get into.

He has become more racist. My dad was a closeted racist before but his racism is now amplified. He has said things about black people that I do not wish to repeat. I have had countless arguments with him about how his racist thinking is wrong.

Our problems became insignificant. I completely understand the stress that cops are put under and the things they may see are horrifying. it is understandable that our problems would seem stupid or insignificant. He did not realize that our problems were valid and also needed addressing. He would invalidate my problems by using other people he had met on the job as examples to why my problems were not that bad.

He cannot show any signs of vulnerability. He cannot stand to be wrong in any way. He will never admit when he is wrong or makes mistakes. I have confronted him about being a shitty parent hoping he would change himself for the sake of his family to which he points fingers and blames others for his actions. It has come to the point where I will not talk to him or argue with him. There is no point. 

I am 24 and have no relationship with my father. He has disowned me for having different views and some of my life choices. Has your parent in law enforcement fallen into any of these harmful traps? How has your relationship with them been negatively affected?"

I  am a 18 year old european, who is by no means a big fan of alcohol. I  get drunk about 6 times a year and occasionally drink a beer ( or a beer  lemonade mixture ) at barbecues ( so like 3 times a year ).

But  I simply can not imagine how stale birthdays as a 17-21 year old have  to be without access to alcohol. I had some of the most insightful and  interesting conversations with friends while being drunk and also  reconnected with older friends on birthday partys after meeting them for  the first time in years. So how do you, fellow 16-20 year old americans  celebrate your birthdays ? Do you celebrate them the same way when you  were 12 , or do you simply ignore the law and drink anyways ?

Edit:  In my country it is also not unusual to not have birthday partys once  you get to 5th grade or so. People only start celebrating them again  once they get access to alcohol. Is it the same for you? I could  imagine, that waiting till 21 is just a bit too long."

So I was wondering - maybe it's time to give up on the political process as an agent of change, and just focus on technology?

After all, if you can solve world hunger by making crops a hundredfold more productive, then you don't need to worry about politicians deciding what policies to enact to reduce food prices.

Or if you can solve the problem of climate change by producing machines that can cheaply suck up all the excess greenhouse gases in the air, with useful by products, then who cares if politicians can't get their act together to agree on limiting emissions?"

I find it really easy to stress about everyone else in the house, where they’ve been and the potentiality that’s every surface is infected. 

It gets pretty stressful: I’ll go to disinfect a surface, then realise I touched the trigger of the spray bottle which others could’ve touched, so wash my hands; only to then stress about all the people who have touched the metal of the tap that I then have to turn off after I’ve washed them. 

Where does it end? I feel if the virus can live on surfaces like metal and plastic for multiple days, how far do I take these precautions? Because of my mental health issues I find it really difficult to know where to draw the line.

My UK (tech) company is in the process of hiring for a senior position. The company is a small business, very friendly and we pride ourselves on being kind and outward looking.

Problem is: we're very white. We have very few non-white employees, and I want to fix that.

There have already been a couple of occasions where one of our non-white employees has pointed out that something in our product is a little... not *offensive* as such, but slightly off-key. The kind of thing that if there were more non-white staff would get picked up on straight away. I don't think anyone in the company is knowingly racist or intolerant: it certainly wouldn't go unnoticed if anybody expressed such views.

So quite apart from social and moral reasons, there's a genuine business case for more diverse thinking and viewpoints from a wider variety of cultures and backgrounds.

We've got recruiters who can advise on where and how to look for more diverse candidates, and hopefully we will be able to get some for interview.

What I worry about is that the interview panel: as similarly senior people, is also going to be all-white. I've been watching a programme airing here in the UK called *The School That Tried to End Racism* and it's (very eloquently) illustrating how white people subconsciously set up expectations based on the behaviour and culture of other white people, and judge negatively people who don't meet those expectations.

As a white interviewer genuinely looking to diversify the racial makeup of the company from the top down (for legitimate reasons, not as some misguided form of tokenism), am I doomed to end up concluding ""whelp, turns out only the white dude was right for the job!"" because of my unconscious bias?

Is there any advice anyone can give me to ensure I'm minimising the effect of my biases? Or am I overthinking it from the get-go?"

I've spent my entire adolescence fearful of the future and pining for the past, where things seeked hopeful. Most people graduating are celebrating their high school experiences as they move forward to their university of choice, but those experiences are scarce for me. I still feel as lost as when I was 12, like a blank slate with the future seemingly all ahead of him when adulthood is rapidly dawning and closing off pathways. I have some vague interest of continuing my education, knowing it's the ""right"" thing to do (and also knowing I'm kinda an academic type at heart, which rules out the typical redditor spiel about trades), but I just... can't be bothered to even enroll at a local community college. That would mean exposing my failures as a teenager of doing anything substantial. It would mean revealing that I am ultimately a useless person who has yet to demonstrate he has a right to exist in this world. I could be replaced with a drone and my life would play out the same, that's how zombie-like and hopeless I feel. There's no excuse for not doing anything other than being a bad person who is lazy and who should be simply forgotten about.

I wish I could erase the past. I don't want that to be associated with me anymore. I want to jettison all the negative habits that have lead me to become a loser. I want to become smarter, healthier, happier. I don't want to drop potential hobbies at a moment's whim when I feel bored, I want to show commitment. Maybe that'll make me into a fully formed person instead of a robot masquerading human. I also want friends, but real friends. Make real connections, not feel like an android mimicking them. All my life I've lied to everyone because I didn't want to be exposed for the monster I am, but how long can secrets persist before they devolve from teenage angst into monstrosities? I need to stop being self conscious ect.

In sum, I want to destroy the past and change myself into a completely different person. Maybe my genes dictate that I will always be a monster, manipulator, and a liability to humanity, but I want to save humanity. Maybe I'm in a euphoric mood (I tend to switch dramatically from that to kill-me-please depression so quickly) but I almost feel destined to accomplish something great. This alienation and suffering must have a greater purpose. Maybe I really am an alien.

With the progressive tax rate, person B will have to contribute even more on top of the 50% increase because his marginal tax rate has increased.
Suppose person B wanted to grind out his hours and retire earlier. Rather than working 40 hours a week for 30 years, he would rather work 60 hours a week for 20 years. Due to progressive tax rate, the hours spent working past 40 hours will be taxed at a higher rate, meaning taxes incentivize him spreading his work hours over a longer period of time.

Essentially if you make 100 k a year you can get taxed 40% of that and have a lot of public services leaving you with 60 k or it can be privatised and you get taxed 20% and you have 80k of dispensable savings and because of competition between companies  you will only pay 10k for those healthcare companies and thus leaving you with more money overall at 70k. For healthcare it seems though nationalising it would be cheaper as I have seen some drug prices that cost maybe a dollar to make be charged for 700 dollars.

I was a bit manic, happy one minute, annoyed/angry the next, sloppy, pretty lazy, untidy, and although I was an anxious person, I certainly didn’t have any worries/preconceptions about the person I was, or at least, no existential doubt that I’m racked with now. I essentially let it all hang out, and was in essence *totally authentic* (for better or worse). I wasn’t really interested in anything that didn’t give me immediate satisfaction, and had no times for books/films/music that didn’t immediately grab me. 

After doing badly in exams, I thought about readdressing my life, and looked to my brother for inspiration. He was the polar opposite to me in every single way imaginable. He was calm, collected, content, mindful, listened to albums and read books, he didn’t overthink, was pretty emotionally repressed, never talked about his feelings.

I was inspired by the person I saw before and dived into his way of life, mindfully reading books, and watching films/listening to albums all the way through, even if I didn’t really feel like it. I didn’t compromise my emotional values as that was really difficult to control, but forged a persona/identity on being way more mindful. For the past 8 years I’ve been like this, believing that this delayed gratification is a good thing. I began to tidy my room, something that my brother was good at - previously this was just something I was never interested in. Although there has been benefits of this mindfulness, (getting to bits in music/art/books that I previously wouldn’t have experienced) I have strayed into hyperawareness and hypervigilancy of me living this mindful life, almost *watching myself reading a book* (if that’s possible).  

However, now I’m totally unsure of who is the real me. What’s my authentic self? Am I a phoney? Should I strike a balance between my ideal self and my real self? This self awareness is destroying me."

Today , the United States is seen as a Bi-Polar country a country with such resources technology and expertise while a large portion of the population suffers segregation and poverty and living in debt. How did US end up here ?

this did not happen over night but since Reagan presidency , they have push to bust the power of employees to negotiate by busting Unions , devaluing work and delocalisation of industry. the Deal made by china long ago now seems as a deal with the devil where companies removed industry from US to china and other 3rd world country where workers suffer near slavery status and companies deal with less laws and over-sight. this in the same time , made companies rich but made a lot of neighborhood and communities poorer because they had less jobs , less saving and paid less taxes for local and federal states while companies minimized their Taxes.

the 90' until now was described as a greed leap in technological advancement and trade by a economist but  hardly as a time of progress. while companies became richer , the revenues of ordinary people stagnated while their debt increased. some countries who faired better then other say India had tried a measure of control on companies and tried a more fair distribution of wealth by social security and aid and programs for poor because being poor can be expensive on the individual and the society in general. in US, you have a big propaganda to persuade ordinary people that social programs and fair distribution of wealth is socialism while companies who get billion and trillion worth of bailout usually from crisis of their own making is Okay. 

the reason while the US administration and hospitals and schools and other institutions are hard time coping with the crisis , is you had a strategy from the right to dis-invest in government and institution and reduce it's quality . the reason US failed this crisis while other government like Denmark or Tawian had a good results is because they  had an effective administration and talented people see state bureaucracy as a good career. in US , you have a very acute and increasing problem of wealth distribution while companies pile up their share the ordinary people and the state are not given enough to invest in things as infrastructure (roads , bridges , hospitals schools , social programs ...).both state and ordinary people are living in debt . people are living on slave wages and in debt.

while in general Free enterprise is seen as the motor of economy in Capitalism , in Us the general opinion that it is out of control and is holding monopoly in several economic sector making life harder on citizens like Healthcare and telecommunication. the stock Market is completely detached from real economy and production and seems to live in it's own bubble on speculation. the problem now is a lot of bailot money is suspected to be used by company to buy back stock to  it seem you need another Teddy Roosevelt or Franklin Roosevelt to put things under control .

an acute unfair distribution of wealth in a nation is dangerous for any nation because it create social , political and economical instability and segregation. you can say you have two societies in US the rich one and ordinary people who now have little contacts in schools , recreation places or place of work and a disconnection of what the other think or need.  you have a real problem of devaluation of people work like Health experts and teachers and pilots. 

in just seems after this crisis , that the social-democratic system of western Europe is more stable and better in general for a society then the ""laisser-faire"" of free capitalism or what is called now wild capitalism. the current failure in US response and problems  is a starvation of middle class and institutions like hospitals and states from resources and a fixation on companies and the stock market."

I’m also hyperaware of the social roles we play in life, the social cues we give off to each other, if they’re authentic or not or learned from movies and the culture we engage with. I question everything and analyse everything, it’s exhausting. After a while, this newfound awareness just took over my life, and I struggle to do anything without being hyperaware of it.

So, I wanna see if other people experience this or if I'm really just consuming way too much alcohol. It has happened so many times where later in the night after a decent amount of alcohol is consumed (approx 15 standard drinks, probably more) I forget what had happened 10 minutes previous. Sometimes it's hours of time that have been forgotten. 

For example, I went out one night and as I was walking I looked down and realised that I had changed into a black dress when I was wearing a white one and it was the first time I'd noticed. I hadn't slept or anything in between that time, I'd just forgotten I changed. 

If I end up fighting someone (not physically obviously) I can be mid fight and have forgotten what we were fighting about. 

I black out a fair bit when I drink, however, I never feel drunk enough to experience the black outs. When I say black out I mean I can't remember anything, usually a couple hours are lost, but according to friends I act the same way I usually would when I don't black out. So we wouldn't expect it to be a black out. I have a fairly good tolerance to alcohol as I have been drinking since the age of 14, probably more than the average person, so 15 standard drinks isn't much to me. 

What I'm wondering is if this is caused by the copious amounts of alcohol I've consumed over time or if there is an underlying reason behind it. I generally have terrible memory, much worse than someone my age should. I know many people who drink so much more than I, yet are completely fine. I live in Australia, it's kinda a lifestyle.

Am I drinking way to much or is there a possible underlying condition I may have memory wise?"

I see an expansion of work from home which results in a reduction in office space being leased and also a movement out of high priced areas since you don't have a commute concern (this is mostly US oriented, but can apply elsewhere as well). I think this concept was already occurring but the virus accelerated it with the shutdowns and evidence showing that the work from home does not always result in lesser work production.

I also see an acceleration of online shopping and delivery as opposed to visiting stores. I see this resulting in a change to real estate in that more industrial locations getting leased and less shopping centers. I also see a change to the operation of shopping centers in that there will be greater demand for pickup so there will be changes to parking lots to allow for curbside delivery and maybe more drive-thru locations. Not sure how this will impact employment - will stores need more or less staff to handle the curbside events? I also think there will be a reduction in malls and the like.

I'm also thinking that roll-out of faster telecommunication infrastructure will occur. As work from home expands, areas will want faster service to attract residents.

So in the talk, it started a 100 years ago when slavery was officially ended but law was used to incarcerate black people so they remain subservient to white manufacturers in north and white plantation owner in the south to remove any bargaining power they have and keep black minority in abject poverty. 

Then in the Nixon era , they launched the crimes against drugs and against crimes . It was aimed against the movement against war and the leader of civil right activist . It caused mass incarceration of minorities who weren't able to find good jobs and was supported by white majority who due to propaganda started to see minorities as linked to crime and drugs.

The result of this campaign can be seen today. As police concentrate on drug users to incarcerate then and not rehabilitate them and crack down on minorities . While in the same time , a lot if times big white crimes like bankers scamming thousand of clients or laundering money for cartels . Police consider themself warriors who fight crimes and battle communities that they should have served. You end up with an over-militarized system aimed at punishing people rather then offer social programs to help them. And a massive jail-security system that profit out of community misery like police targeting minorities for seizures and tickets.

A member had overstepped professional boundaries in their (emotional) relationship with a ten-year-old patient and was using the forum to vent about how frustrated they were about not being able to work their way into his life more. Their behaviors were very alarming and reminiscent of other predators on the site whose posts about their obsession with a child had gradually escalated to contain overtly abusive themes. I was very critical of their behavior in light of this - I warned them that this behavior couldn’t develop in a healthy way and was very likely to turn dangerous considering the OP’s desperate actions thus far, e.g. self-harm, working their way into the family, social media stalking. However, all of the other members jumped on me for “abusing” the poster and argued that since the OP clearly had good intentions (their posts focused on how much they loved the child and just wanted to be near someone they cared about), they probably weren’t a predator. Most argued that good intentions almost always lead to good outcomes and that the majority of predators pursue victims with what they *recognize* as bad intentions. OP believes that their intentions are good, ergo, they probably aren't a predator, and I was abusing an innocent person with misplaced suspicions.

Obviously, I don’t believe this is the case. All of the predators I’ve interacted with or observed, either in personal relationships or second-hand, have self-idealized and believed themselves to be profoundly good people whose actions just weren’t appreciated/understood. Hell, self-idealization is mainly how I recognize someone as toxic. With them, the emphasis is always on how much other people need them and how noble and powerful their own feelings are. One guy I knew who ended up semi-stalking me would actually apologize if he wasn’t able to track me down on campus and impose his company on me every day. Any behavior that is potentially criticizable is taken out of context, in their opinion, and they are incapable of acknowledging that their “good intentions” could ever lead to abusive or unwanted behavior. I’ve always understood this to be the primary pitfall of evil people - the inability to recognize their capacity for evil and the firm belief that their self-defined good intentions must lead to good outcomes, even when they are primarily motivated by selfish interests.

The response I received from other members was so overwhelmingly contrary to this belief, however, that I feel the need to seek out more opinions. The forum this came up on was for people with autism, which is a demographic that isn’t exactly known for their world-savviness. Then again, I could turn the same criticism on myself, even though I’ve had a decent amount of experience with predatory behavior. Reddit seemed like the right place to ask. So: are most predators the sort to linger in the shadows, rubbing their hands together and chuckling breathily over their evil plots, or are they more likely to be self-described saints who complain about a world that doesn't understand their profound sensitivity?"

The Mongols I think correct me if i'm wrong had a few traits come together at the right time for them to succeed and then conquer the world. They had the best horse archers with highly effective communication tactics and just happened to have 4-5 of the greatest military generals in history leading them. The Europeans happened to find the steam engine, discovered the new world which made them finally be able to compete with the far richer 'East' meaning everything from North Africa to Beijing and were able to latch on to the the knowledge of the Islamic golden age when the ottomans were in slow decline post 1683. In the 19th century they were able to the effectively build what I would call 'factory empires' in which the most powerful of these empires the 'British' had the 2nd richest area in the world -India and were able to extract monumental amounts of resources. 

Fast forward to post  WW2 the Europeans can no longer hold on the their empires and this culminated in the Suez Crisis where the US effectively showed they were the top dog of the Western world. I like to call this part 1 of Western Hegemony part 2 in my opinion is the US in which I think it ruled from ww2 to 2008. I say this as this was when the financial crisis happened  and around when China's economy by the most important metric (PPP) overtook the US. In my opinion we have very good reason to believe the dominance of the West is over and will be looked back upon as an anomaly like the Mongols as India is currently having an FDI boom and are following the same path that China did to industrialise but seeing as how technology advances industrialisation gets quicker as times goes meaning that by 2025 we will likely see India as the 2nd largest economy surpassing the US. Current projections are wrong as they just measure rate of growth by which China's economy should only be 4 trillion now, when countries industrialise they typically see world breaking wealth creations. Factor in that the US will be 3rd when it comes to economy their military is expected to be surpassed by China's by 2030 in all but the Naval forces as they are expensive to maintain so they'll just hamper other expenditures. 

Thirdly we should look at Europeans. They have an extremely ageing population that's bit slightly offset by immigration but they we will carry on declining. This is happening meanwhile all of their former colonies will be industrialising post India's Fdi boom after manufacturing leaves there like it left China this year as labour cost were getting too high. Countries like the Congo and Nigeria will see economic booms as they have large very young populations and high amounts of natural resources. When eventually GDP per capitas catch up which according to growth theories they always do power will be proportional to population and Europe will be in far of 25-30th positions. By the time that happens will the current 'golden age of the west' be seen as a historical anomaly like the Mongol invasions were?"

I've taken a metaphysics class which discussed the limitations of taxonomy is distinguishing between species, I've taken ancient, medieval, modern, and world philosophy courses in which various scientists and philsophers have speculated and argued about a defining trait of humanity. But, I'm not satisfied with any answers I've found to the question 'what is it to be human?'. So I ask you, what biological, psychological, physiological,  religious, sociological, philosophical or otherwise, definition do you give to your humanity? What is it that makes you human rather than an other animal? And how would you differentiate humanity from a hypothetical alien species which is capable of similar intellectual faculties as humans? 

Note: while this question is posed hypothetically this is a question which has had serious historical and contemporary impacts of human rights. The definition of humanity was once used to justify chattel slavery in the US and has been used time and time again to justify egregious human rights violations for subjugated peoples around the world. The answer to this question is not merely hypothetical and has serious implications for how we collectively chose to define the rights afforded to our fellow humans as well as animal rights."

I hope that's alright.\*\*\*

In general, I find customers from the G.I. Generation and Silent Generation to be a lot more agreeable and collaborative, in some cases they can be slightly more tech savvy than their younger counterparts. When it comes to Baby Boomers and Gen X, there's this dark shift that becomes really angry. 

Sometimes with problems, instructions get misinterpreted and we need to start over from the beginning. It happens and it's okay, with the older clients they are usually really thankful and they apologize for taking time. For these clients I try my hardest to let them know that it's okay and I can stay on the phone for as long as they need, and in most cases I'm happy to because they're kind and I really want to help them.

With clients in the Baby Boomer and Gen X cohort, the call or interaction starts as an almost battle. I'm constantly interrupted or spoken over, sometimes my instructions are outright ignored and they sometimes say they've done instructions when they haven't or won't ask for clarification whereas the older generations would.

With Gen Z and Millenials, I sometimes get push back but they're never as mean or demanding as the Baby Boomers and Gen X clients. What I think the G.I. Generation, the Silent Generation, Millenials and Gen Z have right is that they are upset and frusturated at the problem but not at me. For the Baby Boomers and Gen X, as a support person or even in other service settings where I've worked I am treated as the problem right along with the actual problem.

Can anyone relate to this experience with working with people across generations? Are there any social reasons for why there was a sudden shift in attitude towards people in service positions and then a shift back with the millenial and gen z cohorts?

\*\*I would also like to note that there are kind people and not-so kind people in every generation. These are just trends that I've noticed working as a person in a service-oriented industry."

hwgu3y,I'm interested in how sexual conservatism has changed when it comes to media portrayal and society.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/hwgu3y/im_interested_in_how_sexual_conservatism_has/,Remote-Boysenberry,88,2020-07-23 22:42:39,32,/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/hwgu3y/im_interested_in_how_sexual_conservatism_has/,NaN,"First off, apologies if my topic title is in all caps. Even with caps lock off, that field changes everything to capital letters? Does this happen to anyone else?

As someone in their 30s, I do remember somewhat of a change in the way that sex is portrayed in movies and TV. Many older movie clips on Youtube that have to do with sex are flooded with comments like ""No way they would have gotten away with this nowadays"". Comments like that are made in a nostalgic, conservative way that almost suggests or implies that people are more sensitive ""nowadays"". That they really had more of an open mind, or were able to distinguish between movie behavior and how you should act in real life, and snowflake cancel culture safe space babies can nowadays only handle acceptable sexual encounters.

The first thing that strikes me is that these people generally (but not always), are the same people saying that our society is so degenerate nowadays because you can see two men kissing on TV, or raising a child. Or there can be a transgender main character. Things like that. All of a sudden, now, sexual portrayal that is even less explicit than their previous examples are too far over the line, and examples of a society in decline. Isn't it a bit contradictory to believe both things? That ""nothing is allowed nowadays"", but then complaining about what *is* allowed?

Secondly, I've never gotten a good answer to what people *were* thinking about these movies at the time of release. For example, I recently watched Blade Runner for the first time. There's a scene in there that to me looked like straight up rape and sexual assault, and is kind of never touched on again. I googled that scene, and found a bunch of articles that talked about the need to ""re-examine"" that scene. I also saw the usual comments about how the radical left is making everything seem like rape nowadays and how it's a shame that the movie wouldn't have been made in the creator's original vision if it was made nowadays.

So I'm genuinely curious. What *would* people in 1982 have thought about that scene? 

* Is it that it wasn't sexual assault, and that's just how you need to treat a woman? 
* Are they saying that they all obviously knew it was assault, and knew not to emulate it. But they think that simply ""banning"" or cutting out such scenes removes that ability to form the nuance in the audience? 
* Or in some cases, were they simply too young to really process ideas of sexuality and consent, but developed a nostalgia for the movie as a whole, and any attack on ""problematic"" aspects of the movie seems like an attack on their nostalgia?

Or could it be something else?

The last point that always confused me is that these complaints always ironically (to me) seem to assume monolithic views on culture and acceptability. For example, my grandparents and parents are pretty representative of middle/conservative social leanings. Kind of like ""silent majority"" types. They're not evangelically Christian, but to this point in my 30s, I have still never heard or said the word ""sex"" or any related concept around them. Boyfriends/girlfriends are not to sleep in the same room when over, that sort of thing.

When cultural critics talk about how ""ugh that scene in Revenge of the Nerds would now be panned if it were shown to today's snowflake audience"", to me it implies that it was received with universal praise in the 80s. Um, I don't think my parents or grandparents would have cared much for it, at least from how I know them. Sometimes I don't think these writers don't realize that a huge chunk of the US population (including old people then), maybe even a majority wouldn't have been ok with that. I think sometimes these people maybe saw these movies in middle school or high school, laughed with their friends, and have an idea that these situations were universally praised.

I've noticed that my family's sexual conservatism is kind of funny in ways - and they probably can't be the only family like this. For example, any reference to actual sex, even if between a married couple, is explicit and bound to make things very awkward. But for example this famous video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Fe3cNWbQQ&amp;feature=emb_title
Would probably have made them laugh at the time. It deals with the issue of predatory men and pedophilia, but it does it with a veneer of innocence, since the host is only looking for ""kisses"". As long as there's nothing actively pushing you to think of a penis or a vagina, I feel like it gets a pass with that old school sexual conservatism. Or is my family the only one like that?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What if there was technology that enabled John Doe to create a world for themselves as he liked it? Should there still be a need for him to be involved in politicking to persuade others to do what he wanted, when instead, he could just avoid the stress and just move to his ideal world? 

&amp;#x200B;

On the face of it, the ability to create your own world - thus leading to a universe of infinite worlds - sounds great. 

There'd be fewer conflicts - if as a conservative / liberal, you didn't agree with the liberals / conservatives in your area, you could just move away to your own world and create your own conservative / liberal utopia.

It would also be a great way to find out which society was the most sustainable. If your conservative / liberal utopia outlasted your rival liberal / conservative worlds, then you could claim victory in the ideological wars!

It would mean an end to arguments about immigration. Far from being seen as undesirables, immigrants would be eagerly courted by various worlds looking to boost their populations with people to grow their (initially at least) sparsely populated worlds.

It would ensure government accountability. Fed up of corruption with your world? Move to a world where your taxes end up doing what they are supposed to do, rather than ending up in a government official's pocket.

&amp;#x200B;

But I see issues as well... it would probably lead to worlds where people were more intolerant and fearful of outsiders. It might even lead to the rulers of such worlds justifying a takeover of other worlds, on the basis that the conquering world was superior to the conquered world.

hzd6yd,Neurotic hyperawareness &amp; over analysis of everything!,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/hzd6yd/neurotic_hyperawareness_over_analysis_of/,Fit_Dot_8360,1,2020-07-28 19:44:03,16,/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/hzd6yd/neurotic_hyperawareness_over_analysis_of/,NaN,"Over the years that I’ve been interested in philosophy &amp; self help I’ve developed a crippling amount of hyperawareness about myself, the people around me &amp; the world we live in. I’m constantly obsessed with getting to the route of everything, and have this irrational desire to analyse everything until I’ve comfortably compartmentalised it in my mind. I’ll scrutinise my own behaviour and others to check if they totally line up with my authentic values. Combined with my sensitivity, it’s quite a toxic mix, as I feel uncomfortable about just accepting that the world is confusing &amp; hard to explain, and that people’s emotions &amp; actions are sometimes complicated. 

*Perhaps the perfect example of my neurosis is the act of smoking a cigarette. Sometimes I socially smoke, but instead of leaving it there and because of the way I am, I’ll feel compelled to analyse ‘why I’ve smoked’, and ‘what it says about me as a person, and if I doing it just to appear cool to others’. I feel like I have to explain myself and all my actions or I feel intense guilt. I can’t just leave something alone until I’ve neurotically picked it apart. Then I widen my scope and I look at everyone in society who smokes, or we all secretly performing when we smoke, but some of us are self aware and notice it, and others don’t? When I see musicians/actors smoking I think, are they just really insecure and are trying to play a certain character.* 

I also do this with my friends and the world/culture/society around me, analysing motives &amp; words, cynically hunting for hidden meanings, and of course because we’re human, there’s usually a subtext to everything. I always think why has he/she said that, there’s got a be a deeper meaning? Very few people are in reality simply idiots, blisteringly truthful all of the time, but I so want to be like this, just responding to stimuli like a simple ape!

Does anyone else have this? Do you think the whole world is aware of this but just doesn’t go on and on about it like I do? Why do I overthink in such mad ways? I wish I could be blissfully ignorant, and not feel compelled to explain the weird reasons why we do certain things."

As someone that lives in the United States, I feel that we have a lot of pull in the world, either toward good or bad. It seems that we're witnessing the fall of our union because of at least one factor that I can immediately identify.

**The majority of people aren't organizing or unifying**. With churches being frequented less often, especially by liberals, we've lost centers of community where people converse about what needs to be done to make the communities better. There are seemingly higher levels of organization on one side of the spectrum which gives them a lot more pull in our political system which is not being mirrored on the other side. That, combined with the phenomenon where the left is fighting for such a wide array of issues that they can't seem to line up their sites to be effective in any of them (economic, social justice, or environment). The left is fighting for so many things whereas the right tends to seemingly fight for corporate issues and maintaining political power which are fairly narrow platforms.

This lead me to realize how much money we are spending per inmate in Canada and how we could potentially use that money to better communities and help heal offenders and victims, rather than use it to keep someone locked up.

What I was thinking is if Canada shifted to a more restorative justice system for non-violent crimes, the country could save money and spend it elsewhere, like mental health programs, education, crime prevention, as well as making communities better, such as drinking water and environmental clean up, restorative programs and community service options.

My idea was that instead of incarcerating people for say theft, fraud, property damage, vandalism, drug possession, or any other crime (as long as ther was no violence used), they receive their ""punishment"" in the form of paying back any damages or the amount that they had taken, plus being enrolled in some sort of counseling/therapy/addiction group, as well as a community work program, like community service or something along those lines, which would also help better the community, if incarceration is necessary, then have it be a house arrest type incarceration.

Eliminating the chance of going to prison for these offences, but still being made to make up for them. I also feel like this would allow people who have committed these offences to come forward and admit to doing these things, which would allow the victim to finally get back what was taken.

In the long run, from what it looks like, this would help improve communities, allow the government to fund other social programs as well as give the victims a sense of closure and actually feel included in the process, while strengthening communities.

So we are both ADHD, and yes we used to abuse our medication D5's. 

The computer was on, no lights, complete silent, and I was just sitting there relaxing and thinking and just listening to silence. Then in a really high frequency just so I could hear it, like so soft, to the point where it was the same level as my thoughts, I heard two people having a conversation outside sitting on my fence, but no one was next door, like empty, no house, bush land. 

Then I got cought up in the conversation somehow, speaking so soft, lower than whispering and hardly moving my mouth, like my voice was being projected by my voice box, like some type of vatrilaquist. 

They stopped talking and it's was a girl and a guy, the girl said ""omg he can hear us"" Then we had this massive conversation at this sound level, once again I was hardly moving my lips, inside no windows through the wall.

Every since that night one of the voices started following me around, I'm talking like everywhere, work, home, gf house, parents everywhere, it started to get really bad and much louder, and giving me heaps of shit hard, about my family friends, people and things they could possibly not know, personal stuff from my life from years ago, man it was torture, and nearly drove me insain.

Sometimes there would be more voices too and they would gang up on me hard.

Now this went on for many years, but all the mean time I started on them the same shit they were doing to me, just constantly badgering them, once again in this vatrilaquist style speaking. 

I'd stopped abusing the medication at this point, cause it just made it worse, I haven't been on them for years now, eventually they went away and I heard nothing for ages, I got married had like two kids went on with my life, completely normal.

But just recently like a few days ago I moved into a new place, and everynight now it's back, smh, but in a different way, when I go to fall asleep I feel like my voice box is being taken over and I start saying shit that I'm convinced the people in the next room can hear, but it's not me, really nasty stuff too, no one wants to talk about it when I bring it up, b cause it sounds like crazy talk.

Anyhoo

My question being, has anyone else experienced this type of thing, and how the fuck so you stop it!!

That suggested an interesting challenge to me - if you had to compile your own mini-library or collection of books along the lines of the Bible of about 1200 pages, which books would you pick?

Ideally, for ""full parity"" such a collection would hit as many of the following points as possible:

* Cosmogony
* Mythology
* History
* Law
* Wisdom
* Self-Help and/or ""Therapy""
* Food for Thought

So here's my attempt:

* Cosmos by Carl Sagan (432 pages)
* The Trial and Death of Socrates [Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, and Phaedo] (128 pages)
* Life of Diogenes from ""Lives of Eminent Philosophers"" (24 pages)
* Enchiridion of Epictetus (64 pages)
* Letters from a Stoic (254 pages)
* Epicurus' Letter to Menoeceus (5 pages)
* Epicurus' Principal Doctrines (6 pages)
* Good Poems for Hard Times by Garrison Keillor (368 pages)

For a total of **1281 pages**. I know there's a bit of a contradiction in including both Stoicism and Epicureanism, but I like aspects of both philosophies, and I think having a contradiction keeps the ""think for yourself"" angle front and center."

Both rivalries feature competing states enmeshed in profound interdependence at a time of explosive technological innovation. Both feature an established democracy with a free-market system feeling cheated by a rising autocracy with a state-protected economic system, and choosing to lash out with counterproductive unilateral tariffs. Finally, both rivalries reveal that such competition is about much more than tariffs: it is also about sophisticated instruments like standard-setting, technology acquisition and theft, financial power, and infrastructure investment. 

 The speed of the catch up was as alarming to British elites then as it is to American elites now. German GDP was 67% of Great Britain’s in 1871 and exceeded it by 1908 in the aftermath of a financial crisis. Adjusting for purchasing power, China’s GDP was only 25% of U.S. GDP in 1990 after a decade of reforms and exceeded American GDP in 2014, also in the aftermath of a financial crisis. Even when their economies eclipsed those of their rivals, Germany and China remained poorer in per capita terms – with German income 74% of British income in 1913 and Chinese income only 25% of American income in 2016. 

China like Germany is trying to avoid being surrounded by enemies and is doing this buy the one belt one road initiative. They were both late industrializers and both had/have the largest stem output in the world outpacing the established powers the US and UK. Even 5G can be analogous as Germany obsessively wanted the best radio system and the UK's frequent tries to stop it were ineffective overall. Germany's economy was already surpassing that of the UK's due to a higher population. Even nuclear weapons had the analogy of warships which were seen as MAD though admittedly less serious. Do you think when an anti nuclear weapon is developed (which seems likely nowadays as we have just discovered what lasers can do to diffuse nuclear reactions thus making them ineffective) one bad ship exchange is the South China Sea can become like the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand?"

I was watching a YouTube review of a Pokemon game and saw just this. To the YouTuber's credit, the message itself was incredibly subtle.

Obviously, there is footage of the game in the background of what they're saying. I noticed a Zigzagoon named ""Trans"", and raised an eyebrow but didn't think much of it. Then later on I noticed that the team was explicitly named ""Black and trans lives matter"". They were in order too, which is probably the only reason I was able to see that. If they were out of order, it would probably go over my head. I didn't see the 6th, but it isn't like it matters much what it was.

That message, of course, has absolutely nothing to do with the subject matter of the video. You would have to go out of your way to name these Pokemon this, put them in that order in your party, then record it and put it in your video, so why?   
On the other hand, unless you go out of your way to be like ""wait a minute"", pause the video, and then read the names of the Pokemon, you just don't notice.

So how do you all feel about things like this? If someone puts in subtle little political or social commentaries that have nothing to do with the video but won't interrupt it or jump out at you because they're tucked into the background, do you just not mind it?"

i2aicz,Do you think that by 2030 the developing world will catch up with the developed world and we will see humanities golden age?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/i2aicz/do_you_think_that_by_2030_the_developing_world/,Ihsanher,1,2020-08-02 19:21:54,59,/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/i2aicz/do_you_think_that_by_2030_the_developing_world/,NaN,"This might be perplexing to read at first because of the situation in the developed world and corona but bear with me and let me explain why I think this is real possibility. I will address 3 issues here : the fastest build up of wealth of human history and end of poverty, the young developed world vs old developing world and over population and finally climate change and why green technology will exponentially be introduced.

Though it may come as an extreme surprise and it definitely got past the attention of the media in 2018 more than half other world population was considered middle class. Now you may be thinking oh middle class in the West and middle class in the developing world mean completely different things. Wrong! Its adjusted for purchasing power parity which is the most useful measure for how large an economy is. Its pretty much being able to live a comfortable life. The middle class in China actually larger than the entire population of America. The reason that this news was shocking though is that in just 2016 they were predicting that at quickest it would happen end of 2020. The reason for this fast build up of wealth was trade liberalization and industrialization. Essentially when you heard of those stories of people working from 12 hours a day in factory getting 1 dollar an hour it was a marked improvement of their life as they used to be working 18 hours a day in a farm making a dollar a year and by the way a dollar can get you a crap more stuff in China than it can in the UK. As times goes on industrialization gets quicker as tried and tested methods are improved and new transport systems are introduced which can gets goods around quicker meaning wages rise faster as productivity increases. There are 2 places in the world with still a major amount of poverty : South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa. The majority of poverty in South Asia is in India and specifically in UP and Bihar. Post corona it was announced that apple and may other Japanese firms were outsourcing there meaning that they will soon leave poverty my guess by 2022. This is because China left poverty after 10 years and they started of with a 40 dollar per capita while India is staring off with 9000 ppp per capita-this will be the largest wealth creation in human history. The last place Sub Saharan Africa will be getting manufacturing after India and is in fact in the process of industrializing as that is where China is outsourcing. First it will be East Africa then West Africa while central Africa eg the Congo should be developing on its own as China and India and the developing world need certain minerals for infrastructure projects and they could get extremely wealthy from that. By 2025 to 2030 the world should have left poverty. Think of it this way- countries that were being outsourced to are now outsourcing for competitive advantage eg Huwaie and there is less labor so there is double the demand for cheap manufactured goods with half the supply of labor.

Secondly is over population.I assured this is nothing to worry about. Its a proven fact when women enter the workforce and people leave poverty they have way less kids. When manufacturing hits certain part of the world like West Africa and Up and Bihar where all the Indians are being born you will see significantly less children being born. The problem we should be worried about is under population and too many old people being supported by too few young people. I think the kids being born now in developing countries are like the boomers that were born in the US in the 60's as they are riding the good wave . By 2060 we could see a situation where every country is like Japan. This however is one of the reasons I say that this is humanities golden age as the amount of young people who will come and innovate with ideas. The developed world can't innovate any more as they have high wealth inequality where cash is kept to the 1 percent and super salaried suburbanites while everyone else work very low wage service jobs meaning they cant fulfill their dream eg more people are working in Apple stores then making the next Apple. Also they have horrific regulations-Brussels effect. However everywhere in the developing world you see a desire to innovate and become rich. Look at Shenzhen China for gods sake. This leads me on to my next point.

Climate change. You might think could the world handle more people requiring more energy? Well though it may surprise you the developing world will have smaller emissions then the developed word due to not developing auto centrically eg putting metros and high speed rail instead of roads and highways as 1) it reduces emissions and 2) it leaves space for more productive units like factories and houses instead of parking spaces and roads- China has 40 metros and India has ordered 30 to be built. There could be a Nigerian boy or Pakistan girl who knows how to fix climate change and could develop new technology but they are stuck in poverty. When wealth increases innovation times by a factor of 1000. We will have millions more minds and trillions of more investments on green technology. Current projections are unfair as they don't include the fact that all developing countries are moving toward sustainable development like India who spends 300 billion adjusted for ppp of green tetch or Kenya who will be one the first to develop in Africa spending on solar. This is because oil is expensive to import. When the world isn't poor and we have 90 percent of the  world solving its problems instead of just the 20 percent we have now I truly believe that will be humanities golden age then when the developing world ages like the developed world we will look back at the good ole days."

They are my closest friends and are engaged and have been engaged for a little over a year. They were supposed to get married a couple months ago, but the whole covid situation caused them to postpone until next year. I’m admittedly a little closer to Jessica, as we are both extroverts and Melissa is more of an introvert. We spend a lot of time with one another, and I hear a lot from Jessica’s perspective about their relationship. 

What initially caught me off guard was some of the things Jessica would tell me about their fights. Frequently, Melissa would get so upset that she would rip off her engagement ring and throw it at Jessica’s face. She would throw her possessions across the room, and would yell at Jessica. Now, I’m friends with both of them, but I think objectively I am alarmed at some of these actions. Jessica is coming to me more and more frequently saying that Melissa is mad at her for no reason, isn’t communicating her feelings, and seems to be upset by everything she does. Even though I love Melissa, this worries me. Are couples about to be married supposed to fight this much? Shouldn’t this part of a relationship be one of joy and excitement and very little explosive fighting? Won’t it only get worse as times goes on?

I would never bring this up to either of them as their relationship is not my business or something I should involve myself in. But I do privately wonder if this is normal. I personally haven’t been in many long term relationships so I was hoping for a second opinion as to whether this is normal behavior."

This is just meant to be a fruitful discussion.

Bernie recently just introduced a bill that would reduce military spending by 10%. It failed but whats interesting is that it go so many more votes than it would have just 10 years ago. This shows that the democratic party understands where the forward movement is going. Its generally agreed that had Trump not been running and dem voters not seen this race as an existential threat that Bernie or Warren would have won. More key interesting facts are that the vast majority of democrats and the vast majority of Americans even a plurality of Republicans support medicare for all. Also the Democratic part see socialism in a better light than they see capitalism according to recent stats. Berniecrats have been winning left and right in congress and are poised to take over by 2024 and by 2028 if Biden wins the next dem candidate we will see will be a left winger.All dem candidates had to be forced left as Sanders shifted the overton window massively. Now more proposals that these populist left wingers support are non interventionism kinda like Trump and increased public spending. If you can add these 2 together I'm sure you could see that this would likely result in vastly decreased military spending. In terms of real military budgets (PPP) China and the USA are nearly matched and I don't think the war company lobbies will be powerful as one of the first things someone like him or AOC would do is ban lobbying. If they decrease military spending and if Russia's or China's spending outpaces the USA they could very quickly take over. The USA if you follow tech closely has not built an insurmountable advantage and is in fact behind on many things like AI and  emerging technologies as lobbyist want more of their shit bought so its been a lot of capital mis-allocation. When China or Russia's or even India's military surpasses the USA and those bases start getting funded anymore and NATO can no longer rely on an a non interventionist government what would happen to the world order?"

In younger children the animals often have front facing human heads. Sideways humans seem to occur around the age of 7 or 8 in children that draw a lot but sideways facing animals remain like that for quite a while longer.
Why is that so?
Is it because it's simpler to draw all the arms and legs that way?
Or is it perhaps that most animals in children's books are also drawn sideways and taken as an inspirarion?"

My parents say it's important that I focus on academics as college is 10x harder than secondary school/high school. I have Aspergers and ADHD so have had problems in the past with focusing (basically dropped out of high school, got into drugs and parents almost made me homeless). This year I repeated but didn't engage in any parties or friends when repeating high school and got the best grades ever along with being medicated.

I feel that focusing on college lectures and homework on weekdays while also getting a part time job on the weekends and saving up for the future would be better.

I'm 21 years old and I've got a story to tell. You don't need to know my name, i just wanted to share this so someone will know of my journey. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently broken up with my girlfriend, i realized along the way of the past year and a half that i was a toxic partner. A horrible partner, she wasn't perfect either but this is about me and my life and what i know in my heart to be true. I'm writing this because i've made a lot mistakes up until this point in my life. I didn't try in high school and i went to college 2 times before dropping out because i was too busy focused on girls and not on my studies. I didn't appreciate the actual opportunity i had in front of me to further my life and become the person i've always wanted to be. Since i was 15 years old my goal was to become the worlds best photographer. &amp; rather than ever truly due what it took to chase that goal. I drowned the pain of my childhood in drugs, and women. I didn't become the quarterback i always wanted to be when i was a kid either, that was my initial goal and dream, and i failed because i didn't take practice seriously. I've made a ton of mistakes, until one day my mind was all over the place and i couldn't differentiate was real and what wasn't. I wasn't able to tell what was healthy, what was unhealthy, and what was my ego versus me truly wanting the best for myself. 

Somewhere along the way i lost the light i had inside me, the light that told me i could do anything I've put my mind to the light that told me anything is possible if you believe and work hard enough for it. 

As of right now I've filled out the application to go back to school because i will never give up on my dream of graduating from a university, even if the path is harder than it would have been years ago. That's my burden to bare. I still want to be the father i always dreamed of being, the father that is able to be present for his child, is able to have a loving wife, and a healthy, happy family. As of right now a few days before my 22nd birthday, i'm going to do everything i can to make a real difference in the world. I can't let that 15 year old kid who dreamed of one day becoming the best photographer he could be, die. 

In life we have a choice. we can either accept our flaws and live within them. Or we can consciously do everything we can to become the best version of who we are....If life sucks and isn't what we were told it was as kids. That's fine, but i won't rest until i become the best me i can possibly be. I need to prove to myself that i am the person I've always dreamed of.

When the time is right i'll come back, log in and let everyone know if i was able to pull it off. if i was able to do it. Until than... i love you guys, &amp; remember. You can do anything you put your mind to.

Sincerely

I'm a physics/maths student myself and quite a good one if I suck my own dick here for a second-top 3 % in my country when you adjust grade boundaries. In my opinion I think scientism -the belief that science trumps all-has become the new Catholic Church. Scientiscm is the only theory that disproves itself as science is always essentially based of an incomplete data set. There is so much shit we don't know and even our methods for measuring things could be completely wrong. The earth could be a billion years old instead of 4 billion the universe is probably not 14 billion years old we are just waiting for new science to come out. Evolution/common ancestry could be completely wrong as we barely have any fossils in comparison to who lived - as scientific American said its like trying to read war and peace having only 9 pages out of the 2000 page tome and trying to extract the story out of there. Science is constantly changing and that is the beauty of it. In fact extinct scientific theories can be more useful than current ones. For example Newtonian physics is still taught in class even though Einsteins theory of relatively disproved it. It can predict an immense amount of physical phenomena yet can't explain quantum physics or the theory of relativity which displaced it.

However if you come out and say certain scientific theories are wrong and against the scientific consensus you are labeled a pseudoscience propagator and often could loose positions and not be respected anymore -this is analogous to being called a heretic in times when the Popes word was above all but with obviously less dire consequences. This is 'poising the well'. The reason Aristotle has been labeled the most influential thinker for the West is because of his methodology not his findings which have been proven false. Essentially he believed in observed scientific experiments however if new evidence comes along than his theory should be thrown in the wood chipper. Now i'm not saying that science has stagnated i'm rather saying that dissenting voices just get thrown out the door - even if their theories are false they shouldn't be dismissed and we should be actively encouraging the next crop of scientist's to challenge existing belief from DNA to evolution to quantum physics - we should be telling them it is all based of an incomplete data set and you should be the one to find the next better theory out there. Without Einstein theories we wouldn't have phones and mobile network and rocket ships. I implore you to check out the Brussels effect- the reason why the only major disruptive technologies have been in the digital realm has been due to the fact that science is now over regulated. Economics shape science as anyone working in a r and d lab would tell you and our scientific discoveries and useful inventions have been strangled. I am excited though for the developing world catching up and having millions of fresh minds introducing disruptive innovations and new science though."

Basically , the explosion and economic Crisis have shown the Decadence and inhumanity of the ruling class and how much Hizbullah is a danger on Lebanon , the Middle east and the world. 

what i am asking is if  anybody is giving donation to never give to the Lebanese Government give to red cross , the UN or any other respectable Organization. after the civil war, from the time of Syrian occupation until now , the ruling class have being running a Ponzi Scheme with the banks stealing Lebanese and expatriate money to enrich themselves , Assad regime and finance Iran War effort. from 90 to now , they have stolen the equivalent of 180 billion dollars from Lebanese workers and economy.

Hizbullah is a fascist wing of the iranian Army it have no loyalty or love for Lebanon or Lebanese we are assets for him to use to finance Iranian Dream of forming the Persian empire. Hizbullah forces are in Lebanon , Syria , Iraq and Yemen and have a large army. IT also have a large cartel organization in Africa , Middle east and even Latin America dealing with all sort of illicit stuff to auto-finance their army.

But not to say that he is all bad, he also does incredibly good things and goes distances people usually don’t go for each other.
And then there’s a person B, hyperaware and very concerned for others. Every step he takes in life that is remotely associated with another human, is calculated to the finest details. He tries causing as less pain as possible, prioritising everyone else above themselves. And in instances where he does fall short and make an error, he feels paralysed by what he must’ve done, often taking longer to forgive himself than the victim would. And for the most part, he can’t decided anything at all. But at the end, he comforts himself knowing at least no harm was done.

With some objectivity, which one would you say is doing better at life? 
Person A would be gaining valuable life experience and getting things done faster, while trying to balance the good and bad he creates. But also living to the fullest.
Person B wouldn’t be getting as much done and would constantly be trying to minimise the bad —which, to certain extent, cannot be avoided being a human being. So he gets only a fraction of things done.

In America but doesn’t have to be American replies only.

I am first generation American  and I spent half my life with my family basically as much as my mom. I don’t know about Asians, Africans, Arabs on this etc. but I’ve never felt I needed my dad (absentee has like 14 kids and counting long story there..) and my college class had a post about this and a lot of my class mates Latino  agreed that they didn’t have fathers/mothers and we’re fine young adults considering.

I always had my aunts, uncles, cousins (moms side) and I never felt I had a void that needed to be filled by having a dad. I’m personally thinking that in America where people black and white (specifically) don’t particularly need to live near each other and their families to live since they can live just about anywhere and be okay, dad and mom are important because that all the family they have near if they aren’t in conflict. 

Minorities tend to live near other people like them who speak the same languages and live in established communities like “home” 
Quick college additive from my former class; Transnationalism; The processes by which immigrants build social fields that link together their country of origin and their country of settlement. These are reasons why cities like LA and NYC are huge for immigrants and we only have family (not fully extended because we are immigrants). Basically a good number of us if not majority live near people just like us or similar enough and we make it where we can kind of thing so I’d assume there’s more support especially when bringing life into this world. 

I just don’t think single parent households are particularly bad unless the person is a teenager or someone who is poor/stupid which is pretty much synonymous with each other and my generation Z right now glorifying single motherhood on the internet (que downvotes). 

Also I’m not advocating for single motherhood either because that’s not a privilege or something anyone should want to be but it shouldn’t be demonized either like the kids are going to be all fuck ups.

No military or economy could come close and the ones that did were all American allies. All nations that were previously closed off and protected from America were now fair game like NK. Hell even China liberalized its market. NATO promised quote 'Not one inch eastward' yet completely broke that promise and was unchallenged. The west had a complete monopoly on high tech industries and the only ones who broke through were in fact Americans allies like South Korea and Taiwan; authoritarianism was largely going to disappear and globalization took the majority of the world out of poverty and these large middle classes were going to want more involvement in politics. Everything was going according to plan- except it wasn't. 

On September 11th 2001 planes struck the twin towers and this is when I propose that the imperial hubris of the US started. In 2003 the US was simply unbeatable in terms of their economy military and their ability to do well just about anything on the world stage. Anyone who would question them couldn't challenge their world order/military or relied on them heavily economically like China. They declared war and destroyed what was previously the 4 largest army in the world. Freedom had taken over even the backward middle east and of course democracy was going to spread -except it didn't.

7 trillion dollars. That the amount spent on these wars since 2001. Money that could have been spent on improving infrastructure, on giving tax break to small businesses, on having the most advanced green technology in the world and dominating future energy markets which China unabashedly controls now - seriously check it out its not even a competition. And the 2008 crisis happened. The world economy was thrown into a recession . Irresponsible lending and the Eu (the other half of the west) never recovered from this crisis. In 2011 a new player was here one that was criminally ignored in favor of the 'war on terror' China. By this time China had overtaken the US when it came to the most important measure of how large an economy is - PPP. 

 Most economists agree that PPP is a better measure compared to nominal as any country in the world can theoretically have the best nominal in the world if they changed their currency. Imagine you have country X and Y, country X makes 10 apples and country Y 15 apples - no difference in the apples mind you. County X though has higher currency so its more expensive to buy apples there then country Y. Even though Country Y is richer in terms of goods as that is the entire reason that currency/paper money is used in the first place country X would be vastly over represented. In fact China tries destroying nominal rates so it can export more thus growing real GDP and developed countries try increasing nominal so they can import more for less as they are primarily service economies (shops,restaurants,SME's) so the cheaper the products the more their economy can grow . Real GDP should be used when talking about military budgets if primarily domestic manufactured (eg not Saudi Arabia and kinda India who imports a lot from Russia) but nominal in terms of foreign aid and global infrastructure projects instead of domestic ones which would have relevance in terms of the belt and road initiative. This how you get false stats like how the US spends more than the next 10 countries combined even though they are just slightly ahead of China's military budget when it comes to real spending.

That not the full story though. When people think of a military budget they think its 700 billion dollars worth of new planes and tanks. Wrong! Most of it goes towards maintenance and salaries but in the US building up the middle east and drowning money there. In terms of procurement China outspends the US by a factor of 2.5 to 1 and has done for 10 years now and they have skipped trillions of dollars and years by just copying US designs but that doesn't mean that China can't innovate. 1/3 of stem output comes from there, they graduate 4 times as many stem students per anum compared to the US and the best engineering school in the world according to US news report rankings is located there. 

The US sunk trillions fighting useless wars against an ideological foe it couldn't hope to beat and in fact made stronger by making it seem like an aggressor, did irresponsible fiscal policy hurting its allies, never growing its military because lobbyist wanted their weapons bought instead of emerging technologies the future of warfare which China completely leads in and has now elected an incompetent buffoon of a president that has destroyed US prestige permanently and made no one want to sign partnerships with the US as you can't trust the American electorate to elect someone who hold up deals. Also in the Islamic world which by 2030 could have 5 economies in the top 10 largest economies in the world and perhaps 2.3 billion people which is 3 times as much as the US and Eu combined - the US helped completely shift the overton window and change discussion - instead of aiding secularization your now seen as a betrayer and an American child murdering sympathizer if you want secularization. Islamist play clips of what Trump/La Penn say about Islam and show horrifying stats like a million killed in Iraq and this frames discussion much like 9/11 shaped foreign policy. In 1990 the US and its allies held the majority of the world economy now they are both suffering from ageing populations who are loosing significance exponentially year on year as economies are falling in line with population rankings. Asia now by far is the richest continent while the West is falling and with Africa's and India's coming industrialization this is only set to increase. China is not the only threat to American dominance. America is the largest threat to American dominance."

I have trouble imagining or remembering faces or stuff in general, I imagine better with my eyes open kinda.

It’s weird because when I was a kid my imagination was too powerful, I would imagine anything like imaginary friends I used to talk to toys and stuff and had loads of imaginary friends and saw stuff and I remember one memory of a lever in my head I’d always close my eyes and everywhere was greyish and the lever in the centre and I’d imagine turning it off and on in certain things like having a good day and stuff but I think I turned my imagination off from that lever when I was a kid and I don’t know how to get it back.

I’m 18 now I used to be very creative in arts and all things but since then my creativity and imagination had gone and it’s kinda bothering me, especially not remembering faces properly, however my inner voice has compensated for it in my head I overthink everything it’s kind of like I can see my thoughts??"

I had a short attention span, I didn't do anything that I didn't want to do. I rarely read books, and when I did I was totally gripped by the content of the book itself, and not just proud of my *commitment to the actual act of reading*. I was way less self aware, didn't have crippling OCD (that I do now), and probably had ADHD.

Then I began copying other people who I deemed to have more 'rewarding lives'. They read books, discussed and mindfully watched films &amp; tv shows, they meditated, went on runs, worked on self development, kept tidy rooms, collected &amp; cared for things. I thought, hmmm, I should get involved with these disciplines. Then like a method actor preparing for a role, I threw myself into these activities.

However, after about 7 years of doing all of these things, I don't particularly feel any happier. Instead the only real fulfilment I get from these activities is this weird self awareness where I see myself engaging with all of these things, and feel proud of this mindful guy that does all of these things. But it doesn't feel truly authentic... It's like I'm pretending to be this perfect person.

What I'm asking is this - Is there a middle ground between these two states? Or should I just abandon all of these disciplines I've instilled in my life and revert back to my chimp like former state.

What is my authentic self? My actions (mindful, healthy habits) or my thoughts (lazy, can't be bothered, instant gratification)?"

The twin towers fell and 3000 lives were taken from there. The perpetrator a 6'6 man hailing from Saudi Arabia who previously helped America against the Soviets. A war which he observed helped lead to the downfall of the Soviets. Their economy sunk and humiliated; their once mighty empire fell from a few religious fanatics hiding in the mountains. They had taken down an empire by over extending their military and exhausting their economy, a feat which he hoped to replicate to the next pillar of evil in this world one which was influencing the increasingly more secular Muslim world. The wicked immoral liberal west. His armies had no chance to defeat that of the most powerful nation of the world more powerful perhaps than all the militaries other than itself combined and besides that the next most powerful were all her allies. The American populace shocked and frenzied with anger demanded an answer from the then president an answer which would soon bring nightmares to the same American public who demanded them.

The two wars were colossal failures. They sunk 7 trillion dollars which could have been spent on : infrastructure, green technology/ future of energy which China now has a monopoly on,even building up your military more instead of useless operations in some desert to kill 5 fundamentalist. Osama was banking on the US response being this and boy oh boy did Bush deliver. The best way to describe what Osama did and the response is from a man you should know and his work perhaps one of the best this century so far, Yuaval Noah Harriri  ""*Terrorists* are *like* a *fly* that *tries* to *destroy* a *china shop*. The *fly* is *so weak* that it *cannot budge even* a *single teacup*. *So* it *finds* a *bull*, *gets inside its ear* and *starts buzzing*. The *bull goes wild* with *fear* and *anger*, and *destroys* the *china shop""*. While the US was focusing on this a new power was emerging one that instead of being a fly is another bull but is still not done with puberty and is still growing yet has already surpassed the size of the bull in the shop. The bull is China's economy. China's gdp in terms of the most important metric (PPP) surpassed that of the US's in 2012 and is now exponentially larger. Their military budgets have been matched essentially and China's spends more on procurement of weaponry by a factor of 2 as the US has to keep all those bases open to bomb those dangerous farmers. Instead of building up failed Iraqi and Afghani militaries they instead built their own and are now a 800 lbs gorilla in their own right . Instead of having the most advanced green tech they have allowed China to unabashedly control the future on energy by being dominated by Chinese companies. Their over spending and over extended military to crush this fly and bad fiscal policy meant that the people were justly angry at their own poverty. This has lead to the rise of buffoons like Trump who have destroyed trust in America globally. Morocco can't make deals with certain congresses only for AOC or Ted Cruz to overturn it in 4 years. All deals now are made safely with China like 5G and such. The American electorate can no longer be trusted.

Finally the third aspect. The rhetoric and actions of American public officials have made Muslims worldwide despise America and its values. If you want to secularize you are now seen as a child murdering sympathizer. American war crimes now frame discussion for much of the Muslim world and I have no doubt that Islamic populist will play clips of La Penn and Trump and show these horrific stats like a million dead Iraqis an this will shape foreign policy much how 9/11 shaped US foreign policy. Now you may think of this doesn't matter as Muslim are weak and divided but it may surprise you that by 2030 to 2050 the largest economies in the world other than the US India and China will all be extremely religious Muslim countries with Brazil and some SEA countries thrown in the mix. Indonesia is already the 5th largest economy in the world Bangladesh,Egypt and Malaysia are all growing at staggeringly quick rates other countries like Nigeria and Pakistan who are suffering from endemic corruption still have huge labor pools and when they eventuality industrialize will be the 5th and 6th largest economies in the world as GDP per capitas catch up. China wasn't a problem until it suddenly was when the world woke up to how powerful it was and I fear that these Muslim States may be on the very same trajectory.

For the money I spent on the car it's been pretty good more or less and I want to keep driving it for at least another few years.

&amp;#x200B;

However I've been having problems lately with one of my lower neighbors and he's been damaging my car.

&amp;#x200B;

I live on the second floor of an apartment flat and he lives on the floor directly below me. He's been out to get me for the past five months since I moved into this flat. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's obvious he's doing this because I'm South Asian. I live in Shepparton, Australia so keep that in mind. This means that my neighbour, who's white, can easily do a lot of stuff against me without a single consequence unless I have physical proof.

&amp;#x200B;

He's been causing me problems lately with the following ways:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Throwing beer bottles at the surrounding driveways

&amp;#x200B;

\* Throwing Potato chips and their backs onto my balcony

&amp;#x200B;

\* Throwing Chocolate milk onto my balcony and putting them under my car

&amp;#x200B;

\* Egging my Car twice 

&amp;#x200B;

\* Calling me a Cunt

&amp;#x200B;

\* Now threatening to bash me and has threatened to slash my tires

&amp;#x200B;

However I can't go to the police because Australia Hate Crime laws are so weak willed that of the thousands of complaints made every year only 21 actually result in a conviction (i.e. see here [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-05/why-are-so-few-hate-crimes/11078972](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-05/why-are-so-few-hate-crimes/11078972) and here [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-03/hate-crimes-rarely-prosecuted-in-australia/11055938](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-03/hate-crimes-rarely-prosecuted-in-australia/11055938)).

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore I'm stuck in this place for at least a year because of my bond in my apartment which is to last for a year. My landlord is also pretty useless as there's no doubt he'd kick me out if I don't have evidence and that this bastard would walk free no matter what. Furthermore it's pretty hard to find a flat in Shepparton so I don't have a lot of options.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to get some decent, specific advice on two matters so far:

&amp;#x200B;

\* How to deal with the situation (Though I'm not asking here)

&amp;#x200B;

\* What kind of Dash Camera I can get for my car (Which I am asking here).

&amp;#x200B;

\* Or should I get a camera that looks and records at the back of my car and if so which kind?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to get something reasonably priced for the most part (i.e. less than $100 AUD) and was hoping to get some advice."

I am a white Irish person living at home with my now nearly 70 year old parents in Ireland. My father made a comment that he is surprised that Huckleberry Finn is not censored because of ""all this snowflake political correctness"". I tried to tell him that not everything with the current and past social justice movements is about censorship but more about putting things in context.

What I am looking for is help with trying to articulate things like racist context of media and biases being important and acknowledging that they are not okay. For more context I have an argument about his denial of racism and in his mind things were not an issue in the past.

In my view and I may be wrong but, Huckleberry Finn sits within a contemporary historical context and our knowledge of that context is important for where it lies as a historical representation of race. My parents started making an example of how there was on BBC television ( which they watched as kids) the black and white minstrel show. How everyone thought it was amazing and they didn't think it was racist so they are not just because they liked it and watched it. 

For me the show is obviously racist as the use of blackface is completely rooted in racist unflattering depictions of people of colour. Even if you could say the ""acts"" are not unflattering or overtly negative it doesn't matter because of the origin of the entire concept.  


Also he made an argument that no one was complaining about it when the show was on air ( my counter argument was that the majority may not have had an issue with it and he just didn't know of the arguments against it).  


I just want to know if I can articulate my argument better."

ialbht,Should we a Universal Basic Income (UBI) in the United States?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/ialbht/should_we_a_universal_basic_income_ubi_in_the/,TheKitsuneMage,1,2020-08-16 11:19:43,35,/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/ialbht/should_we_a_universal_basic_income_ubi_in_the/,NaN,"With the coronavirus pandemic hitting the U.S. hard, the uncertainty of the American economy is making itself clear. As such, I think it's worth discussing whether the U.s. shouls implement a permanent Universal Basic Income for all adult Americans.This income should be liveable and allow Americans to so the woek they personally wish to do, not what they are told they need to do. I could go fuether in-depth into this part of the argument, but I'll save it for another discussion as it in itself is worthy of its own discussion.

To stay within the scope, my main argument in favor of UBI is the uncertainty of the American economy. Nobody jobs are really set in stone. At the drop of a hat you can lose your job and thus lose all of your income. It also highlights the issues with low-income jobs. For 'essential workers' like grocery store clerks(I will admit to being among this class), they are simply in the same situation they've always been except with the added risk of them getting sick, and since many of these people cant afford health insurance, or the health insurance offered by their company has high deductibles they cant afford to pay, they're at an even greater risk. These people already barely have enough to get by(or in my situation, have to live with family and havent been able to live independently their entire life) so why are we demanding them to put their health, safety, and lives at risk when many others can go on unemployment and stay home and safe, or even work from home. I am aware that many grocery stores have increased their pay during the pandemic, but not all have(mine had a temporary $2 raise for a few weeks and a small one time bonus). A higher minimum wage might help with this a bit, but it doesn't particularly solve the issue for those who have lost their jobs, we may have unemployment and welfare, but those only help under very specific circumstances.

My proposal thus is for every American to recieve a basic, liveable income. Not only as a contingency for situations like our current pandemic, but also to help facilitate a more flexible approach to employment instead of people relying on their employer's wages, which can make it difficult for people to quit their jobs and find new work or learn new skills(I might go more in-depth with this issue in another discussion).

Tl;dr: The American economy is very uncertain so I propose a liveable UBI for every adult American. Do you agree or not, and why?"

iauf33,"Why do some pedestrians see the green light at the pelican crossing, but wait for the first person to start walking?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/iauf33/why_do_some_pedestrians_see_the_green_light_at/,x_ray_7,1,2020-08-16 23:38:14,8,/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/iauf33/why_do_some_pedestrians_see_the_green_light_at/,NaN,"Hello. I'm Russian. I have lived for about 20 years in the same town, and have been going by railway to a university at a nearby big city for the last 7 years.  


Until my university transferred all the students to distance learning this March, I used to go on foot to the places I needed, including going shopping in my small town, going to/from the railway station in my town to go to university, and walking from the city transport station to the university and back.  


And it is a lot of times that I have noticed the following phenomenon at the pelican crossings both in my town and in the big city:  


1. The pedestrian traffic light is red. The people are standing at the edge of the sidewalk on both sides of the pelican crossing and waiting. Most of them are not wearing headphones or holding a smartphone or other device.
2. The pedestrian traffic light changes to green, all the people on both sides of the pelican crossing wait for a couple more seconds (yes, people of all ages, including those born after the dissolution of the Soviet Union).
3. Then any person starts walking (in many cases it is me, I spend that couple of seconds looking left and right to see if all the cars have stopped).
4. And it is only then or one-two seconds later that all the other people on both sides of the pelican crossing start walking. Many of them do not turn their heads to look left or right, both before and during crossing.

I asked a graduate of my university if pedestrians in Sweden, where she often travels, also act like that. She replied that it seemed to be the case.  


I always wonder why the people wait for the first person to start crossing if, firstly, they can turn their heads and check if all the cars have stopped, and, secondly, there have been cases of cars running over lines of pedestrians at pelican crossings, i. e. the crowd is not a guarantee of safety.

  
After all, despite all the political developments, the non-political freedom that was achieved with the breakup of the Soviet Union is still there.

The Communist Party and the KGB have long been abolished. Membership in the United Russia and other establishment parties is in most cases voluntary if you work in the private sector. And even the political party membership of rank-and-file public sector workers is limited to paying fees and attending meetings with no control over their private life.

The FSB, unlike KGB, does not repress ordinary citizens for non-conformist behavior unless it is political speech or any unapproved activism, and interviews with FSB officers in public news media say that FSB does not take seriously the Soviet-style complaints about ordinary citizens it gets from the older generation.   


So, based on your experience and knowledge, how can this behavior of the pedestrians be explained? In particular, is it more post-Soviet collectivist mentality or general crowd psychology?"

A cursory inspection of my title might have you thinking this is going in the direction of gun control, but surprise! We're going the opposite direction.

I'm wondering why second amendment supporters never argued for the ownership of ""arms"" as weapons technology advanced throughout the 19th and 20th century. [We made it significantly more difficult to procure things like machine guns and suppressors in the 1930's](https://www.atf.gov/rules-and-regulations/national-firearms-act), and as far as I know, there's never been serious public discord around being able to own grenades, RPGs, surface to air missiles, attack helicopters, directed-energy weapons, laser weapons, artillery, stealth bombers, or any other modern ""arms"". (I'm excluding nuclear bombs from this question; this question is already absurd enough, we'll leave out the ""Legalize civilian nukes"" goofiness for now). If Jeff Bezos wants an aircraft carrier, shouldn't he be allowed to own one under the constitution?

There's a Thomas Jefferson quote that gets a lot of attention in this sphere:

&gt;When governments fear the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny. The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.

While it is true that small arms present significant challenges for an aggressor (see: guerilla warfare in Iraq or Afghanistan), I think the rapid progression of weapon tech and our relationship with the digital world make this advantage weaker and weaker.

To be clear, I'm not saying I want frag grenades readily available for purchase at my local gun store. I'm just curious why the second amendment crowd interprets the ""right to bear arms"" as only ""semi-automatic small arms""."

For last couple of weeks my taste and smells have changed weirdly. Most foods, especially  meats and things fried in oil have a strong cumin-y smell, whats weirder is that my armpits smell exactly the same way. I’m drinking coke right now and it tastes like strong chemicals, not gross but definitely not like regular coke. All else feels completely normal, the only thing I can remember is in march I completely lost my sense of smell and taste for a couple days possibly due to covid.

Does anyone have any idea what this might be?

That the amount spent on these wars since 2001.

This was *exactly* what Osama Bin Laden hoped to achieve with the Sept. 11th attacks. He learnt from the Soviets losses in Afghanistan, (a loss he believed destroyed the Soviet economy and led to the downfall of the Soviet Union) and hoped to repeat that for America. To drag them into a unending war that would sap their Military and economic power. He achieved exactly what he set out to do, America acted *exactly* the way he hoped and predicted.

The twin towers fell and 3000 lives were taken from there. The perpetrator a 6'6 man hailing from Saudi Arabia who previously helped America against the Soviets. A war which he observed helped lead to the downfall of the Soviets. Their economy sunk and humiliated; their once mighty empire fell from a few religious fanatics hiding in the mountains. They had taken down an empire by over extending their military and exhausting their economy, a feat which he hoped to replicate to the next pillar of evil in this world one which was influencing the increasingly more secular Muslim world. The wicked immoral liberal west. His armies had no chance to defeat that of the most powerful nation of the world more powerful perhaps than all the militaries other than itself combined and besides that the next most powerful were all her allies. The American populace shocked and frenzied with anger demanded an answer from the then president an answer which would soon bring nightmares to the same American public who demanded them.

The two wars were colossal failures. They sunk 7 trillion dollars which could have been spent on : infrastructure, green technology/ future of energy which China now has a monopoly on,even building up your military more instead of useless operations in some desert to kill 5 fundamentalist. Osama was banking on the US response being this and boy oh boy did Bush deliver. The best way to describe what Osama did and the response is from a man you should know and his work perhaps one of the best this century so far, Yuaval Noah Harriri ""*Terrorists* are *like* a *fly* that *tries* to *destroy* a *china shop*. The *fly* is *so weak* that it *cannot budge even* a *single teacup*. *So* it *finds* a *bull*, *gets inside its ear* and *starts buzzing*. The *bull goes wild* with *fear* and *anger*, and *destroys* the *china shop""*. While the US was focusing on this a new power was emerging one that instead of being a fly is another bull but is still not done with puberty and is still growing yet has already surpassed the size of the bull in the shop. The bull is China's economy. China's gdp in terms of the most important metric (PPP) surpassed that of the US's in 2012 and is now exponentially larger. Their military budgets have been matched essentially and China's spends more on procurement of weaponry by a factor of 2 as the US has to keep all those bases open to bomb those dangerous farmers. Instead of building up failed Iraqi and Afghani militaries they instead built their own and are now a 800 lbs gorilla in their own right . Instead of having the most advanced green tech they have allowed China to unabashedly control the future on energy by being dominated by Chinese companies. Their over spending and over extended military to crush this fly and bad fiscal policy meant that the people were justly angry at their own poverty. This has lead to the rise of buffoons like Trump who have destroyed trust in America globally. Morocco can't make deals with certain congresses only for AOC or Ted Cruz to overturn it in 4 years. All deals now are made safely with China like 5G and such. The American electorate can no longer be trusted.

Finally the third aspect. The rhetoric and actions of American public officials have made Muslims worldwide despise America and its values. If you want to secularize you are now seen as a child murdering sympathizer. American war crimes now frame discussion for much of the Muslim world and I have no doubt that Islamic populist will play clips of La Penn and Trump and show these horrific stats like a million dead Iraqis an this will shape foreign policy much how 9/11 shaped US foreign policy. Now you may think of this doesn't matter as Muslim are weak and divided but it may surprise you that by 2030 to 2050 the largest economies in the world other than the US India and China will all be extremely religious Muslim countries with Brazil and some SEA countries thrown in the mix. Indonesia is already the 5th largest economy in the world Bangladesh,Egypt and Malaysia are all growing at staggeringly quick rates other countries like Nigeria and Pakistan who are suffering from endemic corruption still have huge labor pools and when they eventuality industrialize will be the 5th and 6th largest economies in the world as GDP per capitas catch up. China wasn't a problem until it suddenly was when the world woke up to how powerful it was and I fear that these Muslim States may be on the very same trajectory.

Somewhere I hear Bin ladin laughing in his grave as Trump makes peace with the Taliban. He won the battle and the war."

Their friends for example are extremely arrogant, insufferable and being around them makes me have a horrible feeling. I asked them why they hang around with these kinds of people and why they have such low standards in choosing friends, while they deserve better friends than that. They respond to me that it's fun hanging around with them. It's not that it's just me who doesn't get along with them. Their friends are horrible to other people too. Why do people who seem so reasonable and fun hang around with such horrible people? Why such low standards? I've seen this recurring pattern.

My friends are friendly, open-minded and curious. They're a lot like me. When others meet my friends, they tell me that they're a lot like me. They say that a person's choice of friends says a lot about them, and the people they hang around with. I think it might be true in a lot of situations.

The FAANG companies are in almost every field of technology and are constantly branching into more. They constantly innovate and apply new technologies without worrying about possible failure because that's the advantage a clear market domination in one field gives you. 

If a new startup comes up with an innovate product, the tech giants can simply acquire the startup or can outcompete the startup pretty easily. In either case, the giant will still remain. The last great tech company to be founded was Facebook, in 2004. They even acquired Instagram and Whatsapp to gain more market share. It seems like a new startup cannot obtain a majority of the market anymore. 

Until another groundbreaking innovation such as the internet happens or these tech companies crumble due to internal failure like mismanagement, I don't think these companies can ever be beaten outright by a startup."

i was discussing this with a friend who thinks that it isn't bad in theory, so i wanted to get reddit's opinion. is this an objective matter? is it ever okay for a well-adjusted and neurotypical individual to be in an intimate relationship with someone who has a diagnosis? if you believe that the answer lies in where someone falls on the spectrum, where do you draw the line? what are some key factors that make the power imbalance too great?

i apologize if this post comes off in any way insensitive. i genuinely don't know much about this topic so i would like to be educated and hear other perspectives!"

So is there a thing called an evil person to begin with? How much blame can we put on an individual and does that really help when we introduce punishment for the individual but don’t go for the root cause? 
Could it be that we punish individuals and have a justice system only to comfort ourselves into believing that things are okay, while turning blind eye to the issues society creates as an organism? 
There’s a space between how a person is treated and the reaction he gives, and that space is free will, sure, but every person is emotionally/psychologically different, what are the grounds that we decide on that a person’s free will was really under his control?"

Today we had an argument because she's so controlling and has the most ridiculous pet peeves. When I was heading to my room I heard her talking to my brother saying how she staying calm on purpose just to keep provoking me that made me lose it. She'd always starts arguments and drama just be entertained, a few weeks ago she had a huge attitude acting like my mom who's an estj with a terrible temper. She threw a broom at my head and pulled the chair I was sitting on because I didn't do what she says. Then she was fighting with because we were supposed to be cleaning but he was hungry and wanted some food later she ranted to me on how he was worthless and she was going to get a restraining order on him when she becomes an adult. During that time surprisingly I didn't and I'm a violent person. She admitted she's likes to put people in emotional and mental and that's one of the things I despise about her, she's controlling, unrealistically arrogant, overconfident, bitchy, insensitive, manipulative, cold, unempathetic to people's feelings, and nerve provoking. She's such a hypocrite she doesn't like when someone's bothering but she enjoys to get people riled up. I have bad fantasies because of this, for example, I would fantasize about torturing, kidnapping and killing her. I would also fantasize about taking my life and letting people know she was to blame, everyone turning on her while suffering with guilt and shame which she deserves to feel. Just so you know I never have any intention to do this people think of this kind of stuff when feel they have no control over their lives. I'm an unhealthy infp so of course we aren't going to see eye to eye. What bothers me so much is I can't stay mad for long I want to but for some reason I cool off too quickly and I hate it. So the point is I'm tired of being merciful with and she needs a suitable punishment because she's emotional sadistic and loves to bring people down. How can I get revenge?"

If there are indeed infinite universes, then that would mean there’s a 100% chance that infinite universes have people who have mastered world-hopping.

That means infinite numbers of World Hoppers will travel here, and will be EVERYWHERE.

Sure, out of the infinite numbers of universes out there, there’s a chance that we haven’t been spotted. However, that must mean that the universes out there are finite. While there’s a 100% chance that there’s an undiscovered universe by world-hoppers, infinity is still infinity. There’s BOUND to be a universe out there who’s residents have discovered this undiscovered universe.

Speaking of undiscovered universes, seeing there are infinite universes, there’s a 100% chance that one of these universes has yet to be discovered.

1) I’m Sorry, I’m Trying - nothing.nowhere
This was from a time I struggled with severe depression. I was being abused by my boss and didn’t have any backing from the company. This song came up on Spotify radio on the day I drove home after standing up to him, getting moved to a new team, and finally seeing hope for the first time in 6 months. 

2) These Days - Rudimental
I was needlessly cruel to someone I loved when ending a relationship. Hearing this song made me ache to apologize, even though so much time had passed. I would attempted to reach out when drunk, then delete the message, and repeat the cycle. I hope we can get to the point where we can talk and be mutually happy about each other’s lives, even if it didn’t end up including the other one. I only want happiness for them. 

3) Somebody that I used to know - Gotye
I heard this song for the first time on the radio the moment after my first love contacted me to let me know he didn’t want me in his life anymore. Not great timing for a song, and I was definitely not a fan of hearing it EVERYWHERE for the next 5 months either. 

What are your songs? Why do they mean so much to you?"

I'm writing this because i turned 22 last week and it's put a lot of things into perspective. You're at the age where you see everyone grow up and you see who they're becoming and you're proud because you've known these guys since you were kids. But you get in the position where you think to yourself "" Ok, who am i going to become?"" Human beings have a natural tendency to want to avoid pain, but than we realize it makes no sense to avoid pain because it's all a part of life. I'm sitting here 2 documents shy of enlisting in the united states navy because i figured a few years of hard work and being on a boat would probably do a good job of clearing my head. I just want my life to count man, i want to die and know i made a difference in someones life or that something small i did helped a kid understand that life is scary but if you do your best and never look back. You'll be ok, that's all. Excuse me if i sound emotional, but life is short man, and as human beings we're charged with the task of making the world a better place. We're charged with doing what we can to help people have a sense of fulfillment in life, because we know from the time we're children until the time we become adults our world view was broken. Anyway to wrap this up. If anyone is reading this, and you're having questions about life and questioning existence, and you can't help but wonder what your place in the world is.

Some of those people might be closer to the problems than others, while the rest can ignore the issues to a large degree. 

Few of these people actually realize the opportunity cost of living this way... of constantly turning the other way when faced with a challenge. 

When we ignore large-scale, complex issues because we believe that they're beyond our control, **we sacrifice the life that we could be living** if we just addressed the problems head-on.  

For example, if we wanted it to be so, we could create some system similar to a basic income and have our basic necessities taken care of by default. At that point, work would be an option to gain more discretionary resources. That's just one potential way we could be living more optimally... there are many more to an almost unlimited degree, depending on our imaginations. 

But the major frustration is we're stuck in this world, as is, with the status quo breaking down on us.

1-Things that are haram are usually things that are done by choice and that have bad consequences for the people involved here are some examples:

*Murder : Is bad because you are taking someones life (And is an action you have the choice to do)

*Stealing : is bad because you are taking someone's rightful property (Also a choice)

*Rape : Leaves victims with mental scaring and issues (Also a Choice)

*Incest : You are making babies that are nore likely to be born with disabilities

*Alcohol : is bad because it ruins your brain (Choice)

  so i don't see why homosexual thoughts and actions are considered among these since it doesn't leave Victims and is not generally a choice you have (since believe me i would have loved to choose to be straight if it meant less trouble but unfortunately homosexual people can't choose that)

2- Isn't islam supposed to be the religion of a acceptance of all despite their differences ?
why is it not when it comes to homosexuality

3-The Argument of ""God created ADAM and EVE"" implies that if anyone has autism then he isn't valid because ""Adam and Eve"" didn't, if someone is a different skin color to Adam and Eve does that mean they aren't accepted. people are different and don't fall into a singular box to tick.

4-If Sodomy is the reason you are condemning homosexual relationships, then does that mean Lesbian relationships are allowed ? i mean there is no Sodomy happening

5-""Homosexuals can't reproduce"", so can't infertile women so why are they allowed to get married and have sex, i mean they also can't reproduce

6-There is a lot of talk about ""Lut's people"" but Lut's people generally horrible people who were greedy and stingy and commited rape and incest, but also in the story of Lut when they try to rape Lut's angel visitors both men AND WOMEN were there

7- Isn't punishing homosexuality leading to more suicides which are Haram because god wants to preserve life and insits on staying healthy mentally and physically and loves all his creations equally

There are many more people, especially teenagers, that have crippling mental issues.  I don't know if this is normal for restaurants, or maybe just the area I live in.  I often get frustrated when working with them, because I often have to pick up the slack.  Here are some real examples of people I've worked with.

&amp;#x200B;

One girl would run away from the register if a customer talked to her too loud.  With everyone wearing masks, people are naturally talking louder anyway.  She will go to the back to cry for 10 minutes before coming back out.  After that there is only a 50/50 chance of her continuing her shift and not asking to go home.  The management did nothing about this.  They would let her sit in the back for 20 minutes and not even clock out.  If I asked for a 20 minute break to be paid, they would laugh in my face.  Plus I would have to pick up the slack because she basically would just walk off the floor without notice.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've also seen a lot of transgender teens get hired in recent years.  Honestly, most are pretty chill.  They don't get upset if you call them the wrong name or pronoun accidentally.  We did have one person though that was a big problem.  So they were biologically female.  You could tell by looking at them because they had breasts, long hair, makeup, and even a female name.  You would say they are a girl.  However they wanted to be called by he/him.  I found it really confusing, and so did everyone else on the staff.  They would flip out on customers if they said something like ""excuse me miss.""  I was again upset with management because I feel like if I talked to customers like that, I would get fired.  It seems they were able to get away with it because they didn't want to offend a ""trans"" person.  I put trans in quotes because I'm not even so sure how sincere they were.  I honestly think they were doing it to mess with people.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh... and the granddaddy of all crazy teenagers.  This one I work with now.  They refused to learn how to take orders at the register because of their anxiety.  No problem, we'll just train them to help prep food.  Well they can't do that because touching food that is ""squishy"" is triggering to them and they will have a breakdown and cry.  So basically the only job they can do is run orders out to customers.  If food is on a tray or in a bag, it's okay to touch apparently.  That is literally all she can do, and doesn't take a lot of brain power to accomplish.  However she would keep disappearing every 10 minutes to go cry in the back and have a panic attack.  She couldn't spend a whole 30 minutes on the floor at one time.  Of course she has dayside availability because of online school, so we kind of need her right now.  We are short staffed already, and it helps just to have another pair of hands to run orders out.  She can't even do that, and the management doesn't do anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping some of you may have some insight.  It's been this way for the past two restaurants I've worked at.  This is so commonplace now that I'm scared for the future.  I have always believed that jobs that hire teenagers can also serve to teach them important life skills and responsibilities.  However, these kids look like they are beyond help.  If I was a manager, I don't think I could put up with any of them.  I'd rather run short than try to put up with these issues, especially since I don't think all of them are sincere."

I haven’t become dumb as a person, Although it has made me socially awkward in public if I’m not smoking with the people in the room. It’s like I’m living in my own thoughts and not actually in the moment, and here’s what brought me here.  Me and my 2 good friends did an eighth of shrooms last night. For the first 2 1/2 hours I saw no visuals at all. My friends (who keep in mind smoke 3-5 times a week as I smoke 5 times a day) We’re trippin balls and I decided to use weed to see if it would activate it. And it did. But It made the shrooms into a very awful trip where it didn’t feel like I had a mouth and it felt like my bottom jaw was out of place. It was one of the most uncomfortable experiences in my life. But here’s the thing, In the last month or 2 on occasions I’ve been having Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ) when I smoke. Which if you don’t know what it is it’s the tightening of someone’s jaw. Not as bad as lockjaw but it is very uncomfortable and I believe the amount of weed I’ve smoked is the immediate cause for that. I don’t want to quit quit. But I don’t want to smoke every day all day anymore. My plan was to only smoke after 10 pm. Because I have trouble sleeping and it’s a good relaxer meaning I can use my mind throughout the day and sleep soundly at night. 
Another way I thought about reestablishing my missing psyche was to micro dose lsd (10mg every 3-4 days) I’ve taken lsd and it helped me with depression and anxiety but weed has brought me back down and taken effects away from lsd that I wish I could experience again. 
But I’ve been reading that if you micro dose lsd it can spark creativity and help social anxiety. 
I’ve been thinking about quitting for over a month now. Any advice or personal story would help me out, Thank you - psycheque

P.S. The shrooms trip became very beautiful and nice after an hour or 2 of panic and I ended with the mindset of not needing weed as a crutch. So I’m happy that my bad trip turned good and came out with a positive mental state."

Lord John  Acton have a good amount of saying about power and goverment but the most famous is :"" power tend to corrupt and absolute power corrupt absolutely.""

I live in the region of middle East which is a trove for Psychiatrist for dictators gone insane with power or show inhumane level of corruption . Basically a patriarchal system where the head of family can do no wrong ; the book "" superman is an Arab "" is a nice read on subject.

Some people could be born competant and good and some  selfish and corrupt. I am interest if any say of revolutionaries that reached power had at first benevolent intent and then go bad with unchecked power or just hiding their lust of power? Quadafi was a revolutionary and then years later he declared himself king of Africa a nice example of power going to once head. Another example would be Erdogan who called himself a reformer and statesman and now declare himself the heir of the Ottoman emperors. 

But it isn't just heads of state but a more local situation like policing or companies can show abuse of powers . In US , we see a rather belligerent and violent police compared to other develloped countries.  It have a history of different abuse on minorities and lack of oversight that gave it a bad rep and a culture of corruption and violence.

Power can go the heads of CEOs and executives in the coming age of Mega-Corporation . We have seen giants like Facebook and other media empires using their business to less scrupulous intent. 

So basically , does power corrupt everybody ? Or does the so called "" reformist "" or "" revolutionary "" we're corrupt from the first .  So does unchecked power can generate negative mental states like Narcissist and ego-mania or such traits already exist in persons ?"

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies in advance for the wall of text, but i wanted to set out what this company does and how it does it (according to them) in order to spark a more informed discussion.

I've just purchased one ton of carbon removal from this company. They are a touch unclear on details but basically the way it works is that farmers in the scheme adopt particular farming techniques in order to sequester carbon at a higher rate than their normal methods. Once they have recorded one ton of removal, they send this information to Nori who pay them for their efforts, funded by credits bought by people such as myself. Each ton must remain sequestered from the atmosphere for a minimum of 10 years, according to Nori.

In terms of the science, the idea is simple, that you can move carbon from the atmosphere into the soil using plants. It was previously my understanding that all or at least the majority of the carbon plants remove from the air is then found in the plant biomass itself, thus releasing it again as it rots/burns etc. According to Nori though, a decent amount is actually stored in the soil in the form of microbes, again, something which you can affect by your farming practices. I presume they know the rate at which this CO2 then leaves the soil (presumably this is affected by the concentration in the soil, so scaling may be an issue). 

In any case, they claim, again with slightly sparse details, that such a method can store ""gigatonnes"" of carbon, which compares to the 880 gigatonnes humans have released and the 1.5 trillion (I think 1.5K gigatonnes?) we need to remove to reverse climate change, according to their claims. Now, what i'm not sure of, is whether or not it would be in principle possible to use all of the arable land in the world (or at least all the arable land we currently use for farming) to store this much carbon with their methods- is this in principle possible? That is my main question I'd like to see discussed here.

My overall thoughts on this is that it is a very good idea- it gives individuals some level of control over climate change, purchasing credits allows Nori to go out and find more farmers to get onto this scheme, who can actually be given a financial incentive to help, not to mention, overtime, they could diversify their carbon removal methods to include direct air capture and storage, for example. My main concern is that this is a solution which, even at its maximum theoretical scale, is still too small to fully address climate change."
ipcyyc,"All this demand for ""woke"" culture about being different, diverse and standing out is nothing special and is more like embracing victimisation and attention-seeking behaviour or simply marketing.

 I am not saying that there is no such thing as oppression, unfair treatment of minorities and desire for system changes. By all means, if such a change is desired than go for it.

But I feel like all this ""woke"" culture is literally everywhere - from demanding diversity and embracing about being different, to the desire to stand out or fight against authority or whatever strong figure that this culture demands as to fight.

A few examples:

*  someone adding a diverse character in a film but the only defining trait is that this person is diverse and nothing else. Ok then, what else? What else is there to this character apart from the fact that he is diverse?
*  The pointless ads on Youtube that are clearly meant to exploit this ""woke"" culture with the same old message *""it makes me sad that people are going on with this old way that is so inefficient""* making it as though they became aware of something and would like to change it but does not say what is that is so inefficient or what is that they would like to change or how they would like to change it 
*  Screaming out loud on the top of your lungs about embracing your culture or your rights or whatever when nobody else seems to be demanding it like being transexual and demanding respect but being aggressive about it
* Screaming and encouraging to stand out without clarifying the where and when because being different does not mean that it is valid or useful

It is ironic that on how ineffective this is because this quantity of this done over and over again without the adequate quality has become so annoying that it makes me want to walk away from listening to these ads and messages which is completely the opposite of what these things are trying to convey. 

It makes think that some of this ""wokeness"" comes from a place of bias or seeking confirmation bias or a sort of projection."

Spreading awareness is a complicated issue (and so is mental health) because you have to compile long lists of data and research in a simple pile for everyone to understand. But I feel that this can be done in a much better way.

I feel that mental health awareness is more about sensationalised/romanticised marketing where the aim is more about profiting from these hardships instead of giving the right messages on how to deal with said issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I have heard this phrase countless times ""this guy (ex: Einstein) was pretty smart. He must have been autistic"".

Ok fine, maybe he was but what does that have to do with anything? Do you have to be autistic to be smart or gifted? Why should all of their habits, traits and behaviours be related to their mental disorders or whatever kind of mental quirk that they have?

 I have heard and seen this type of romanticized model of mental illness countless times where people who were smart or had an influence on the world in some way had mental illness, or fictional characters in films or TV who are influential or legendary have mental illness. 

It is ironic that you are trying to make this person more appealing because of his/her mental health issue but you so focused on this trait that it becomes a defining trait and neglects everything else.

So you are basically replacing one label with another

Not to mention the over-emphasis on the benefits or the more romanticised side of mental illness without focusing on the realistic side of the issue. Trust me, I know that autistic people can potentially be brilliant people underneath, or a person with depression can make beautiful art.

But very little is shown how difficult it is to be around with these people or how difficult it is to live with these kinds of issues.

I feel that this is like the X-Factor where you put this sob story where you are meant to feel sorry for these people or feel pity but you do not give them that sense of humanity and it is just there to exploit our emotions for the sake of marketing and sensationalism without focusing on the real issues that how to deal with them"

In my experience, entities (gov't, corporate, etc.) tend to operate more effectively when siloed into smaller units. It seems as if a lot of inefficiency in federal government stems from the fact that frankly, governing 330 million people is difficult. Bills have to withstand the fact that they may have extreme support from the religious base in the South but also extreme resistance from a liberal base in New York, for instance. Is that kind of gridlock good?

I imagine if split up, incentives between the governing bodies and their constituents could be much more closely aligned, problems could be handled with more focused/localized nuance, and political fighting could be much more infrequent if territorial lines were redrawn. Blue Illinois could just treat Red Missouri the same way we currently treat other adjacent countries: a territory with a potentially different political system, possibly even culture, but with whom we can still more or less get along with politically and economically.

Of course, individual states have their own red and blue bases, but for the most part, wouldn't governing e.g. Colorado as its own individual country be a lot easier? Could an amicable split even be possible or would it always amount to some form of conflict?"

I have been told that im not doing my job right but not being shown what im doing wrong and how to fix it, instead lately after I was laid off from covid through a text message after my shift that day and now coming back they just been pushing me away from some of my job so now I really don't like being there. Plus im constantly being told im doing stuff wrong but no explanation. Yesterday I had my 3rd write up and to be honest im not really sure for what I was so shaken up i didnt read it and signed it. I was also offered a garenteed job somewhere else yesterday but im not sure if I should take it id be happier with new management and its closer to home. Although it is a gas station so sadly no animals and id be losing about 16 hrs and making about 2 dollars less. I know I could still cover bills if I manage some stuff and help with my fiance too. Everyone I've asked says do it except my mother who is well a karen and doesn't approve of me moving out with my fiance who she hates. Not sure what I should do but I need to make a decision asap I basically start training monday for the gas station."

Could a decentralized social network work?

How I would see it, there would be a standard agreed upon template and design that individuals could host themselves (like wordpress). Hosting companies could provide simple no code setups (like they already do with wordpress). If you are technical you can modify it how you like, but it would also be ready to go out of the box. 

There could be a free centralized service (probably paid for by ads or donations - wikipedia did try to start a social network) for those who don't want to host their own but the option to host your own would give you more control over your data and experience. 

There would also be a standard api for connecting your profile to friends or groups of people. And you could still have a feed that periodically calls your connected friends pages for updates. 

One challenge would be security, letting people host their own could be a nightmare for malicious data. I am thinking maybe a three fold approach. The centralized service would not allow as much customization so pages hosted there would be secure. Self hosted pages could be validated by the centralized service (run tests against the page) or pages could be marked secure by some sort of network reputation. (enough of your network considers your page safe and has run a validation on your page). 

Maybe multiple forms of validation, one for security and another one for usability. I would probably want an option to flag a page as annoying if it became like a myspace page of the past. Doesn't mean it isn't safe, just as a warning to people exploring my network. Maybe instead of a warning, it is something like keyword tags, this person is really into hiking and join a ""web-ring"" about hiking. This other person is into annoying webpages with instantly playing music, so they get tagged for that.  

Social media as it stands today is a mess. But there is still a thread of human connection behind the idea that I think we need to develop. Especially now with most of us seeing each other less and less.

Maybe part of this is nostalgia for geocities and everyone having their own sites. I would love to get back to that but maybe with a little more polish and some api's to connect us all together."

Unfortunately, I can’t remember where I read this, but Wikipedia seems to confirm it: on average, [about twice as many women as men identify as “not completely heterosexual”](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_sexual_orientation#General_findings) in western countries.

I think this is a really interesting demographic because of all the layers it has. I can think of a multitude of possible reasons for the above result to have been reached by surveys, and those possibilities cover a broad range of fields, from neurology to social science and even experimental methods. Additionally, the poll results are muddied by unfortunate social issues and by differences in definitions used. Therefore, I thought I’d ask the people of Reddit what they think.

To be clear, I’m interested in sexual orientation, not in sexual activity. If a person is attracted exclusively to people of the same sex, I classify as homosexual regardless of whether or not they engage in homosexual behaviour, for example.

Here are the possible reasons I can think of for the result:

1. **Biology:** Women are more predisposed than men towards non-heterosexual orientations due to neurology/genetics.
2. **Biology:** Women are more willing than men to try new experiences, and some of them discover they enjoy those experiences. It’s not that men are less likely to be non-heterosexual, but that fewer of them even realise they have (or could have) non-heterosexual orientations.
3. **Social acceptance:** Unfortunately, publicly identifying as LGBT+ still has negative consequences in some parts of the world, and it could be that women tend to be more willing than men to take that risk, possibly due to men having “more to lose” given the (also unfortunate) patriarchal system that remains in place in much of the world (men more commonly hold higher positions and receive higher wages and thus might see themselves as having more to lose by admitting to a non-heterosexual orientation and facing negative consequences). It’s not that men are less likely to be non-heterosexual, but that fewer of them are willing to admit that they are, regardless of whether or not the survey is (or claims to be) anonymous.
4. **Social acceptance:** Continuing in the patriarchy vein, in a society where most men identify as heterosexual and many of them might find homosexual or bisexual women more attractive (as potential romantic partners in the latter case, as friends in both cases, for other purposes in both cases) or simply more acceptable (due to not finding them actively unattractive, as opposed to homosexual men), women face social pressure to engage in non-heterosexual behaviour, and either this itself skews the survey results or this enables them to realise they enjoy something they might not otherwise have considered, as in possibility 2 above). (Note that whether or not this social pressure actually exists is pure speculation on my part, as I, along with most people I know, am fully accepting of people with any sexual orientation and nobody I know has ever made mention of feeling pressured in that way, at least in my presence.)
5. **Semantics:** Some surveys define sexuality according to orientation, while others define it according to activity/behaviour, with several shades of the latter stemming from whether they enforce a time period (“has engaged in nin-heterosexual behaviour within the last *N* months”). This muddies the waters somewhat, making any statistics unreliable until the two types of survey are separated and results are given along with the type of survey they resulted from.
6. **Experimental error:** Any number of factors can influence statistics and make them unreliable, including taking too small a sample, sampling only or mostly within a specific group (nationality, ethnicity, religious beliefs), people lying on surveys (for whatever reason), questions being misleading or unclear, people placing boundaries between different orientations along the gradient in different spots (one person attracted only mildly to members of the same sex might identify as heterosexual, while another person with the same orientation might identify as bisexual), etc.
7. Any other reason I haven’t considered.

Which do you think is/are the prevalent reason(s) for the “twice as many women as men” result?"

[Dealer's Voice: Operating a Dealership in a Small Town has its Benefits – WHEELS.ca](https://www.wheels.ca/news/operating-a-dealership-in-a-small-town/)

&gt; Another difference between rural and urban dealerships is the spirit of community. That’s not to say that strong, vibrant communities don’t exist in Toronto, Hamilton or Ottawa (they very much do), but in a small town, that sense of belonging and community is amplified.
&gt; 
&gt; It’s common for me to encounter employees or customers when I’m buying groceries or shopping in town. This happens almost every time I’m in public.
&gt; 
&gt; Which brings me to an issue that is part of a small community, where everyone knows everyone, and that’s reputation. If any local business isn’t treating its employees and customers fairly or providing great service, word quickly spreads and its reputation would suffer.

[How to Sell Cars in a Small Town | Small Business - Chron.com](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/sell-cars-small-town-47762.html)

&gt; ## Meet and Greet
&gt; 
&gt; At a big city dealership, the meet-and-greet sales step occurs when customers enter the car lot. In a small town, you need to get out into the community and introduce yourself to the population so they know who you are. Visit the local spots where people gather to socialize, such as a favorite breakfast restaurant, women's groups and the local high school sporting events. Small-town residents like to buy from someone they know and like.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Consistent Pricing Policy
&gt; 
&gt; Selling cars in a small town requires a consistent pricing policy. Your customers will talk to each other, and they should receive similar ""deals"" when they buy a car. You must be able to hold more profit than the big city dealers are willing to take, but you cannot take advantage of customers who would be easy, high-profit marks for a smooth-talking salesman at a high-volume dealership. Explain to customers how your price on a vehicle benefits them in both the short and longer time frames. An initial price offer should be close to a no-negotiation deal, but keep a little back to negotiate away so the customer feels like he won a concession. Do not give concessions on your sales price. Instead, bump up the trade-in price or give a special price on an add-on like an extended warranty.

&gt;[The flip side is that small towns far away from big cities don't have any competition. So if I want to look elsewhere, the Honda dealer is 50 miles away, Mazda, Saturn, Kia, etc. are 85 miles or more in different directions. So comparison shopping trips can eat up the savings of cheaper prices. Locally, Chevy, Chrysler, Ford and Toyota are all owned by members of the same family.""](https://forums.edmunds.com/discussion/comment/2602256/#Comment_2602256)

&gt;A [""larger dealer will have access to a larger pool of inventory. My employer has 60=something stores, each of which have 40–100 used cars at any given time. That can mean getting a better deal than at a smaller dealership because you can end up with a different car that meets your needs.""](https://www.quora.com/Do-big-car-dealerships-in-big-cities-give-you-better-deals/answer/Jon-Miller-99)"

are there are people here who are wearing a deceased family jelwery? if so I would like to know if there is a need to go to a priest and check the ring with him, or what should I do ? before jumping in and wearing the ring.

Kind of makes me feel like a failure. 

One example could be coding. I started it with the intention to specialize in it but at the end of the day i realise there's a lot to do in this field and i have no specific deadline so I'm not even determined to learn it right now as i feel i can do it later. But the thing is lockdown was the best time. 

Also when i begin to do tasks i get overwhelmed by how much there is to learn and that's another factor that intimidates me (sometimes in a negative way)

I really want to find something I'm passionate about. Something that just drives me, without me having to push myself to start doing the task. Something that keeps me ignited with interest throughout.

Overall, I'm quite a determined and ambitious person when i have strict deadlines. But ehen there are none, I'm slack. 
I also have a proffession that i want to pursue in mind, but i doubt i really wanna do that. Maybe I'm just attracted to the career because it's lucrative. I want to find something that i would love to do."

Then he destructively scans his brain, converts it into a pattern of human neurons, and prints that pattern into the brain of the cloned body. In other words, he transferred his consciousness (or a copy thereof) from the alien body into the human body.

The result is a body made entirely of human tissue, arranged almost identically to a normal human. The only difference is a change in brain layout.

My question is: Would you consider this being human? Why or why not?

Bonus questions:

- What about a human consciousness in an alien body?
- What about a beating-heart cadaver?
- What - if anything - is the smallest change you could make to a human's brain that would make them no longer human?

The empire always faced barbarian incursions and invasion and usually resolved by bloody solution with legions.  The real cause of collapse of empire is a conglomerate of problems some similar to what modern Society is actually facing .

The economy of Roman empire was slowly being hampered by climate change and several plagues like the Antonine Plague  , and large mismanagement and corruption and overpopulation in some cities. All these problem contributed to Rome not being able to repulse barbarians and support a large professional army. 

I fear that modern Society is on a similar trajectory.  Climate change might be even worse then what scientist expected with more severe disasters that cause famine , draught and devastation.  And worst of all , conflict when ressources start to lack . We ve seen some bad examples like the conflict in Darfur .

We ve seen how a small thing like a virus ( Covid) can cripple even a modern and globalised economy that even with advanced technology struggle against the virus. 

 The greatest fear and problem is humanity turn on each other when the climate change hit it's epix. When we should stand United we turn on each other . The reaction against covid made me think we have little chancd for an orgonized worldwide response against climate change and the action of certain nations like building dams on vital rivers and use it as blackmail chips is even more worrying . 

Are we in a situation where current system is slowly being chipped away with more and more severe crisis and less ressources each time to respond to it ? Can the current society collapse to a more survival of the fittest system and lot more chaotic and unstable ?"

I am Chinese American myself, but I don't want to reveal my identity. Instead of giving you the usual BS about keeping the art separate from the artist, I will just say that I am mostly concerned about privacy. Anyways, this insistence on pseudonymity may cause some to believe that I am a white ""colonizer"" engaging in cultural appropriation, and I wanted to know how to deflect such accusations without showing a photo of my face or my DNA test results.

Here are some possible routes:

- Fight back by insulting the accusers and telling them to F off. It might get them off my back the most easily, but bears the side effect of my work being associated with the right wing, and alienating liberals. The liberals that I alienate may include potential collaborators. I want my art not to take a side, and appeal to as many as possible.

- Fight back more softly by arguing why it's not cultural appropriation, why the concept of appropriation is groundless, etc. I am not sure how much it would help, in particular if the accusers have a vested interest in taking me down.

- Ignore completely. Pretend none of the controversy is taking place, refrain from responding to complaining posts on social media and silently delete them after a while, etc. I could see this work in a small scale, but if I make it big and start to work with collaborators, then it may be more of an issue that I can't ignore away. For this strategy, I may have to stick to Instagram and Facebook and forgo Twitter.

- Apologize but continue to make art. This may have a similar effect to ignoring completely, or it might put me into a deeper hole by giving the mob more power. Also, when they find out that I had apologized but are still going on with my work the same, their wrath may be greater.

Any other ideas?"

And again, he also has 'color privilege' in the sense that he's not too dark skinned and studies have shown that lighter skinned blacks are treated better by White Americans as well as black Americans."

I am from Germany and I became interested in this topic because I often see how enterpreneurship is pushed very very hard in America, almost glorified to an extent, while here in Europe, or at least western Europe that isn't the case at all. So I asked some questions to the few americans I know and they almost all told me that american corporations, at least the big ones, have unreasonably detailled and hard interviews, to just gatekeep for the sake of it, often have problems with middle management that loves to micromanage and in general, if your performance is not up to par you will be fired on a whim. So that it's safer, and often more lucrative/fulfilling to start a business yourself, rather than torture yourself through the corporate swamp.

I don't know how much of this is real but that is why I'm asking this question today. Is it really the case  that for corporations in America, management decisions often border on employee exploitation? It also seems to me that the drive for competitiveness is way higher, which is a total contrast to european culture, where a balanced life and private/free time is more valued. 

I know this is a generalization, so let me specify it by saying that we are talking classic business/office/programming jobs, basically white collar jobs. Hopefully you can answer me this question, I am very curious to hear your opinions. Thanks!"

They even say ""why can't they speak proper effing English without that accent?""  and a bunch of other things I won't even repeat because it's just pure ignorant.

Side Note: I have so many friends that are Hispanic/Latino... Some legal and ""illegal"" (I hate that terminology) and they work sooooo freaking hard. Especially the ones here illegally. My friend works his ass off during the day, and takes English classes at night. Every one one of my illegal friends takes English classes and busts their ass. It's HARD. They constantly work on improving their English and I help them whenever I can. And then you have rude people like my family member that will make them feel like their English isn't good enough because they don't sound like a native English speaker. It pisses me off!!!"

Early 2010s were an era where people hadn't yet become incredibly cynnical - where pop music was crowded with EDM dance hit after dance hit, where people were excited about technological progress and what the future could bring, and where brooding superhero films like the dark knight trilogy gave way to more upbeat films like the Marvel E.U.

Now it appears we're in a severe period of depression, cynnicism, and pessimism. Popular music is a weird a rehash of grunge, nihihlistic rock music, depression pop, drug abuse rap, and moody indie music. Optimistic escapist films are being perceived  as cheesy or contrived instead of celebrated and we've come full circle with the release of Joker. Technology is viewed as a force of corporatism and distrust rather than a source of wonder.

We all can probably explain why the later 2010s became this way. But what about the early 2010s made it specifically a period of optimism?"

We have been living in an age where you can super stimulate yourself with all kinds of things. Tobacco, alcohol, sugary products, porn and more.

Some people I know go pretty all out. They buy loads of junk food, loads of alcohol, consume a lot of porn, have a video game addiction and so on. While I definitely think everyone should have the freedom to choose to consume, I feel like people can get REALLY angry when these are not given to them.

I saw this happen during the early days of the coronavirus lockdown in my country. Liquor stores were shut, people couldn't go anywhere except get food and groceries and they were just not used to it. I am a firm believer that people should find inner peace within themselves and not let consumer behaviour take control of their lives (you control your consumption, don't let the consumption control you).

If people are not entertained, they get bored as shit. This doesn't apply to everyone but I have observed first hand just how angry and restless a person can get when deprived of these super stimulants. 

But when they got their liquor, junk food, endless video games, endless porn and so on they seemed content. It seemed like it a pot overflowing but all of this is just a lid put on them from exploding. There is no doubt that consumerism boosts the economy and people's overall quality of life.

They made the argument that constant kindness is actually self-serving, because people act kindly either to build good rapport with other so that others treat them kindly in return, or to make themselves feel better for being kind.

jdngtj,Why aren't there any live action anime hybrids?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/jdngtj/why_arent_there_any_live_action_anime_hybrids/,Reel-Rookie,1,2020-10-19 04:18:44,2,/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/jdngtj/why_arent_there_any_live_action_anime_hybrids/,NaN," I never really thought of this question until after watching Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

I can admit that I have seen Japanese animation with live action footage spliced in (like in the End of Evangelion movie) but I have never seen it fully integrated with the story or characters like in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Space Jam, or Pete’s Dragon.

I have [read this pretty interesting article](https://www.animenation.net/blog/ask-john-are-there-any-anime-live-action-hybrids/) where a guy discusses most of the well known “anime live action hybrids” but he never really gives an answer as to why Japanese animation doesn't do the whole hybrid animation thing more often.

I know this is a subjective thing and everybody is going to answer it differently, but why do you think Japanese animation doesn't do the whole live action animation hybrid thing as much as western cartoons?"

And for that claim this is true for all fandom, I have never seen people for other fictional characters get this worked up and offended over a fictional character before.

For example- I made criticism in the past when discussion on why the Justice League failed that it was due to them making superman too strong. I mean in the film he practically defeats the whole team after just coming back to life and then proceeds to beat the main threat of the film causing the ending to be anti-climactic. You can even see the reaction of this by the youtube comments from the general public on the final battle of the film.

Within hours, superman fans start attacking may and saying how I should educate myself on the character and realize that he should be that powerful. They then went on to defend this as good storytelling claimed that it will pay off in the future when the rest of the team gets to superman's level. After which I was accused of wanting the JL movie to just be another avenger clone.

Another instant, the topic of superman films come up. I stated that 1 and 2 were good films but were often overhyped due to nostalgia. I then went on to state that 3 and 4 were bad films before again I was attacked by superman fans who claim they were not. They then accused me of being a hater with some fans admitting the film was bad but Christopher reeves performance in them was still interest.

And god forbid if you make a comment of stating you prefer X character over superman because you find him boring. The personal attacks, insults and lecturing from fans just keeps on coming one after the other.

Why are superman fans like this? I've made criticism and comments on other fictional characters like flash, green arrow, wonder woman before and never have i received such hostility for not worshiping a fictional character."

Sometimes I am a very random person. I would tweet about how apples would look better if they were purple etc and this person would agree lol. I honestly felt seen and heard, because I could tweet very random small things and they would heart/like it. 

Fast forward to last month. There is this band I just discovered. I kept tweeting about it because I have ADHD and when I love something I talk about it for DAYS. And then they tweeted (without directly mentioning my @) that that band sucked ass. That it was trying to copy some other band. Etc. which made me mad. I felt hurt and my ego was bruised. So I cut access to my account just so I would not go to twitter anymore. 

The thing is... I actually wanted them to see me as cool. So I would obsess over trying to get my twitter so I could still “show” that person that I’m cool and not lame. But since I deleted access to my twitter there is no way to recover it and it is eating me alive."

Let me divulge:**

First he pours his guts out for Trump's election campaign, and runs the Trump White House Transition Team, only to get shafted at the final hour by Jared Kushner in a perfectly orchestrated revenge move for locking up his father, Charlie Kushner.

Now, Christie isn't running NJ like he once was, and probably could use the cash and certainly could use the political relevance points. When the phone rang and the words 'Please hold for the president' could be heard, Mary Joe (his wife) probably collapsed as she passed him the phone. If you read his book 'Let Me Finish', you'll know that she was persistent from the very beginning that serving the interests of Donald Trump will only come back to hurt him. He relented nonetheless.

He was probably on the next government paid private flight to DC to assist Donald in his 'debate prep' against Joe Biden. I can only imagine how frustrated his face must've looked when he was watching Donald backstage in the Trump green room, as he most definitely disregarded any prep that his team contributed.

After that debacle of a debate, he's on his way back to Mary Joe on the Jersey Shore (probably sent via Greyhound) and is greeted with the news that he brought COVID back with him,

**CONCLUSION: Chris Christie must hate Donald Trump.**"

TL;DR: with the rise in tech that can literally measure our thoughts and translate them into movements, do you feel that the universe at large can have a similar reaction?

[Also, if you do not believe in law of attraction, I'm happy to hear your input, I have no judgement of anyone]

I'll try to make this post short, and let me preface this by saying I have no formal training or understanding of current technology.

We've all seen videos and demonstrations of new tech that can read thoughts, measure brainwaves and turn them into things. Biggest example being tech that quadriplegics use to walk or use artificial arms.

At the same time, the universe (in many people's eyes) seems to work the same way. We see what we want to happen, we believe it wholeheartedly, and things seem to manifest. The example I will use is Morris E. Goodman, the man who was paralyzed after a plane crash, and used his thoughts to make him walk, breathe, and talk on his own again.

I'm summary, (and I have no judgement on any answers here!) What do y'all think? If thoughts can literally be measured, so they have a quantum effect on the universe and atoms that surround us? Let me know how you feel.

Thank you, and much love to everyone."

I've recently become close friends with a bunch of guys who never went to University. Until recently I've maintained friends who either also graduated uni or didnt. The latter group I generally consider 'dumber', intellectually speaking than me and work more 'blue collar' jobs (sorry, I know. Im a wanker).

My new friends hold the opinion that university is a waste of time and money. While I agree that it often leads to awful debt (like I currently experience) my thoughts have always been that University gave me a great deal of knowledge, taught me critical and creative thinking and I'm generally better off for it.

These guys aren't dumb, but they're a little conservative in their views compared to me. We often discuss how I studied at tertiary level when they didnt. I got my masters while they worked in lower positions of careers they currently still work in. They earn more money than me, they also think creatively and critically,  but I often get the feeling these are new skills they've picked up with age/experience. 

I often struggle to explain to them the benefits of University because of the above points - I'm not smarter than them or more advanced career wise but I've generally felt with lesser educated people that I hold something of value that they're missing. (Told you this would sound pompous)

So, other than crippling debt and some fun memories, what did University give you? I know this is a hard thing to generalize on, and every person is different, but I'm just looking for some pro-university arguments :)

It's going to be a long post – thank you in advance to whomever will read this. English is not my native language so there might be some mistakes.

I am a 29-year-old girl from Italy, with a mild knowledge and interest in politics, especialy when it comes to important political events of the past (I was pretty disinterested in history throughout all my school years, for a start...I just studied it mostly to get good grades) or when it comes to get accurate and detailed information about current political events. I tend to just keep up with the news on tv and sometimes read some political commentary online, most of the time not knowing what the “best” opinion about something should be exactly, and always mostly trying to understand what the point of view of the journalist is instead of forming a strong opinion about an event. I never really understood how some people could actually be convinced by slogans that a lot of the time seem to be really simplisistics and hypocritical, how they could be genuinely interested in all that...I just always felt an undertone of disillusionment regarding politics that never really went away with time and that prevented me to inform myself better and maybe to form a stronger opinion on an array of things. Anyway, I don't think that this vision is “right” or good; I am aware that I am ignorant about the subject, so I tend to talk very little about strictly political things IRL, limiting my commentary on events that are socially relevant and easiest to discuss.

In all this disillusioned stance, I tend to think a lot about people expressing more extreme political views, positioning themselves on the far-left or far-right spectrum, people that gather themselves in political organizations, that have strong beliefs that shape not only their ideas but their lives, people that can use violence on the streets to express or to defend their political ideas. How they do this? What is that make them so invested in a political ideal or party? Do they always know what they do or want politically speaking or it is just a need to have a more mundane “faith”? On one hand, a lot of extremists ideas scare me a lot (particularly far-right ones, but I have doubts about some far-left stances too) but on the other hand I am kind of fascinated by people that are actually passionate about politics so much that they lean towards more non mainstream ideas or anti-system positions.

In the end, I find myself searching for political related news or extreme opinions online more to try to understand and analyze people behaviours and thoughts than to form a firm opinion, more to reflect about what politics is to others than what it is to myself, more to get more and more confused than to clear my mind. Do you have/ Have you had a disillusioned approach to politics like mine? How do you keep informed and interested in politics? What is your stance towards political extremisms?"

Some examples are: Adam Sandler, Miley Cyrus and Cara Delevingne.

Adam Sandler a comedian and cracks jokes. I found his humor good indeed, but it got repetitive after a while. I don't consider his humor to be top-notch. Miley Cyrus... I don't get it at all. She's below average in looks, her performance is below average, below average talent, and her singing is not that good. It may indeed be good to some people, but I gotta admit, it's nothing extraordinary. Cara Delevingne's looks are below average and her acting is not that good at all. I'm not only talking about these examples in particular. I'm talking about average celebrities in general.

How did these people get famous? How did they win among hundreds of different applicants who are more competent, and having better performance? There are much more competent people out there who are more extraordinary, and yet these average people are more famous. Their performance is either average or below average. 

Why don't producers choose the best and most competent applicants? Why do they choose mediocre applicants like these? There are people who deserve this position more than them. So how did they win, compared to their peers? I don't really get it. At this point, the conspiracy part of me is suggesting that they've sold their soul in some way, lol.

I've been doing some serious research and soul-searching for the last year or so, and I believe I have come to my conclusion that Trump is the better candidate to lead America (despite his outrageous personality, I know). I am worried about what my friends and family will think, and if my vote will ever be leaked somehow some day. I know voter records are kept, but I REALLY don't want to advertise this and I hope people will never get to see which candidate each person voted for. I am just being honest. The social stigma on this is just too much, but I know in my SOUL that this is just the best thing for us, whether you like him or not. 

I want to come to terms here. I don't want to be labeled a bad, or racist person. I am not the least bit racist.. I haven't seen any proof of Trump being so either. I think he's done a GREAT service to the people by calling out the fake media, big tech, corrupt politicians, etc. I'm not a fan of his personality either, but man, a spade is a damn spade here, and I can't be going crazy. He is literally putting his life on the line to expose everything that's been wrong with our country and people just give him shit for anything they want. 

Should I just give up my own train of thought here and adopt to the way most people are thinking about Trump? Or go with my own rationale and just do it. I don't want to regret this, and will have to accept the fact that I voted for someone who makes dumb remarks all the time. If it gets out I will probably lose 80% of my friend base too. I just don't understand how everyone is so concerned with his personality and not his actions. He has proven his resilience and determination at this point, and Biden hasn't.

I'm not interested on judging the boys or girls for their choices. I'm just trying to understand that phenomenon which I observe in my school, and with my friends. 

But here we go;

Well, here in Brazil, we have an expression called ""Zé Droguinha"". Witch would be something like, the ""Drugged Jack""; those boys who uses... well... drugs haha"" 

And the point of the ""joke"", is that a lot of times it refers to how girls/women get attracted by those guys. 
""– Look at her. She is with that Drugged Jack, dude.""
And most of us men, gets amazed by that. I""ll explain why (if it's necessary, idk):

–By the perspective of one of them, I would say that they/we get envy about it. More or less, by a sense of, ""being righteous doesn't pay off"".

But, there is a lot of others examples of girls getting attached to ""bad boys"" throughout the history, so I think you could know what I'm talking. The point is that I think that is dangerous to men; Since they will try to make a lot of bullshit to imitate them, just to attract the attention of the girls!

I can see a lot of originally romantic guys, who just give up and start to treat girls ""different"", just to be that bad boy. Or just being encouraged since a kid to turn that way.

Trying to be clever, I think that they are just trying the wrong girls. They I falling in love for the wrong ones. Maybe theres also be a lot of girls out there, who are also equally romantic. But they are (for some reason) chasing the wrong ones. I imagine that, because I also hear from girls that they also like some sort of romanticism. But there are only dickheads all there!

But looks. Can you see the cycle?

Man try to be good &gt; Get Upset &gt; Become the ""bad boy"" and make a lot of bullshit = Woman complain that men are stupid....

That cycle doesn't make sense. So basically, I'm exposing he stupidity of us men haha"" 

But well, I can't get sure about you girls... Why do you think that happens, in your POV? Why does girls sometimes prefers the bad boys? Would that just be some sort of curiosity? Or are they funnier? I've no idea haha""

Well, thank's for reading this far. And sorry for any possible mistake. English is not my first language :)"

Today in New Zealand the preliminary cannabis referendum results were released with a majority marginally against legalisation. The current laws are widely seen as perpetuating disproportionate Māori incarceration rates. Legalisation, while not a panacea to this issue, was argued to, in part, alleviate the systemic racism Māori are subject to. 

A rhetoric floating around from the legalise campaign is that a no vote is, and was, a vote for racism. 

But there are some valid concerns regarding cannabis legalisation such as drug driving and police resourcing to uphold legalisation, among other things. 

So, the question comes to whether it is racist to vote against the legalisation, citing your concerns for drug driving and even acknowledging the racial harm of the laws? Can you be indirectly racist? 

Much like voting for a political party or candidate in which you agree with most, but not all, of their policies. 

Further questions: 
Can you silo these issues? 
Or is there no possibility of separating them? Because it could be argued that at the end of the day, whether you intend to or not, a no vote may perpetuate the injustices? 
Can the proposition that a ‘no vote perpetuates racial injustice’ hold true while voting no and not being racist? 

Would love to see some discussion to help flesh out these topical questions! Thanks!"

Any species that evolves on a planet will more or less face the same scarcity and competition for resources as life on this planet.  Accordingly, I expect that when they are/were at our stage of development, they were probably no more moral or kind than we are.  Over time, humans have overall become a less violent species (despite what the media may have you believe).  Obviously our weapons of war have increased in power and we have done a lot of super efficient killing in the recent centuries, but I am talking about the overall tendency of the average person, and the statistics of things like how many wars are there, how much crime is there, now much hunger and disease is there.. on almost every one of those fronts, we are moving in the right directions.  Now is the best time to be alive, statistically speaking.

 As society has developed, We have industrialized compassion and empathy and have become far more capable at being effective at acting in line with those concepts.

We have also industrialized violence and war, but instances of those are decreasing over time.  I think this points to the fact that IF a species can make it past the stage of development we are in, they will have more benevolent characteristics in general than violent characteristics, as the advancement of society beyond some points appears to be contingent upon benevolence and cooperation winning out over conflict and divisiveness.  If a society does not wrangle that in, I think they have a large chance of destroying themselves.   On small scales we see it... working together is almost always more effective than infighting.  

The second prong of my argument has to do with eliminating scarcity.  Looking at our own species, if we continue to advance like we are it is likely that we will have the technology to make all the necessary things we need to survive and thrive totally through autonomous and renewable means.  The convergence of technologies like renewable energy, energy storage, robotic vision, AI, and advancements in control of dynamic complex machines (robots) are eventually going to create a super capable, powerful automated infrastructure that can sustain and maintain itself and provide everything we need to exist.  I think there may some some horrible hiccups along the way, but in order to advance to the level of a true spacefaring race, we will by default have to overcome those issues and reach the potential I have outlined.  

In this scenario, once scarcity is effectively elimination, and the provision for existence are readily available to everyone for free, the entire dynamic of society will be transformed.  At this stage we will all have likely access to some kind of brain computer interface that will radically transform and elevate the intelligence of the average human.  Since more highly educated and intelligent people tend to show less violent tendencies, we should be in great shape.  

If this line of thinking is right, I think it tells us that the only kind of space faring race we should expect to encounter is going to be totally integrated with their technology, unlikely to need any resources from us, and generally benign as far as being a threat to us is concerned.  I could be way off, but this seems reasonable to me and I have been thinking about it for a long time.  First post on Reddit BTW, better late than never.... :)"

We can note that there were often social media challenges and trends around the world. Among them: Ice Bucked Challenge, Until Tomorrow Challenge, Kiki Challenge, The 10 Year Challenge, etc. 

What it’s all about: 
These challenges are often initiatives by well-known social media users who have a wide reach, followers who go through the feed of the respective influencers on a daily basis and just want to be part of these challenges and trends. 

What if we shift this a little bit. 
Trends developed against Corona. Who makes the best masks?( creativity contest features on social media) apps which help older people do their shopping, young people who introduce the younger generation to what role they play, and how they act well and deliberately and how preferring fun activities in these unprecedented times can endanger other people’s lives. Masks should start to be free of charge. ( Here we could create a small fund) We should allow in more countries for older people to buy only for themselves from 8-10 o’clock. Older people tend to sleep shorter, so they are awake earlier. I was frightened about how many masks are on the ground everywhere, we could develop a trend to pick up those masks and throw them away. Unfortunately, recycling is particularly difficult. Mask controllers, focus on throwing this away? #againstmasksontheground #disposeofyourmaskscorrectly


I look forward to your ideas, and I hope the post makes sense. I think we should just be more proactive and take advantage of the digital world."

I’ve heard arguments mostly pointed towards it being bad especially for women:


It conditions people to not really build meaningful relationships (when things go bad just go to the next person). And to continually sacrifice one’s youth for short term hedonistic pleasure. Furthermore you’re more likely to not be able to maintain a monogamous relationship once you’re used to this life style. 

A woman has a much shorter period of time than a man, to find a life partner to raise a family with. 

Once you’ve reached your 30s-40s as a woman your dating pool shrinks significantly. Even further still I think there are not too many men who would be interested in dating a middle aged woman who has “slept with the entire town.”


I never really thought of any of this until I ran into a discussion about it on Quora. What are your thoughts?"

He responded bear attacks that large would have meant Bill Gates would have never created Microsoft, and Jeff Bezos would have never created Amazon.

""I am making this post so it will show back up as a future memory on my timeline: Today is three days after the 2020 election. Gasoline is currently $1.99-2.49 per gallon. Interest rates are 2.65% for a 30 year mortgage. The stock market closed at 27,848, even though we have been fighting COVID for 9 months. Our GDP growth for the 3rd Qtr was 33%. We had the best economy ever until COVID and it is recovering well. We have not had any new wars or conflicts in the last 4 years. North Korea has been under control and has not been testing any missiles. Isis has not been heard from for over 3 years. The housing market is the strongest in over 20 years. Homes have appreciated at an unbelievable rate and sell within hours of going on the market, with multiple offers.
If there is new leadership I hope they can build on these things and can keep them going (copied).""

Can you all help me take a closer look at these ""successes""? 

For example, I looked up to 33% GDP growth in the third quarter of 2020. This appears to be a rebound from a 30% plus decrease in Q2, and 5% plus decrease in Q1 (I know, COVID). Saying there was a 33% increase in Q3 initially looks good, until you realize it was a rebound. It's a fact, but it's nuanced. 

Can you all help me articulate the other nuances in the post above? I probably won't respond to the friend on Facebook, but I'd like help with the fact checking here."

I started this year as a strong Christian Republican and I've slowly swayed to indecisive. I honestly don't want to be a negative part of the world and I think its important to not be ignorant on political topics so if I am wrong in this post I promise that I'm more open to change than you think.

The comment:
I don't think he said he hates her. Thats kind of exaggerating it. I'm Christian and if my child was LGBTQ I wouldn't be happy but I would treat them the same as before and I wouldn't shun them. If you do it because of your religion your valid as long as you don't make it the child's problem. I'm not going to tell my child how I feel if I feel like that could hurt them in anyway. The child's health comes first but I'm not going to a rally because that just isn't what I believe in. If I see someone being bigoted I'll step in because you shouldn't make your believes someone else's problem but I'm not going to praise LGBTQ people. That's my take and if I'm wrong please explain why because I feel like this is a very selfless take and expecting someone to defy their religion further than this is kinda asking them to forfeit their beliefs for the slightest convenience of others. I'm not saying I don't like LGBTQ people I wouldn't be friends with LBGTQ people if I didn't like them. I don't have a prejudice, I have a religious obligation. I think its weird to call someone homophobic because they won't treat LGBTQ better than a straight male. The goal is inequality and imo the way to divide is to be more extreme and less neutral. If you want people to change you have to see where they're coming from no matter how wrong they are. 

Edit: He definitely is the asshole and you should always support your daughter as a daughter not for her gender. I don't understand why I'm part of the problem if I've said I'd defend LGBTQ from bigoted people, and I wouldn't be bigoted towards LGBTQ. Don't respond to me calling me homophobic and quote me saying I don't like LGBTQ when I never said that. Its fine if you point out something that you think I'm actually doing wrong like not praising LGBTQ (even though I disagree) and you've quoted me saying that. (I think if you prefer an apple over a banana but no one would be able to tell that based on how you act, thats equality and there isn't anything wrong with that.)&lt;--- I think that's controversial and I'm open to someone explaining why thats wrong. I'm open to changing my mind I'm not super firm on that idea because I can see some ways thats wrong.

Tldr of Edit: Don't put words in my mouth, but call me out about something I actually said. I think equality isn't based on preference but on treatment.

And even if you do want a purpose or meaning (even though I would like to know why many people crave this altogether) isn’t it fulfilling to give this to your live by yourself?

The cheapest option would be around $500/month for my wife and I, or maybe just $300 for her alone.  I can't get insurance through my job (as we don't have enough full time employees to require providing healthcare).  I also make too much to qualify for any kind of help.

They say there isn't really any downside to hospital bills, as opposed to say student loans that accrue interest.

I think they are annoying, uncomfortable, and dangerous to ankles. I do not wear them. 

My friend and I were having a discussion. I have been drawing characters he's come up with so he has a concrete visual for them, since that's something he struggles with. (For some characters, all he has for them is ""tall"" or ""dark hair"" until I give him with more.) 

This one female character has a noble background. She excels in the political circus and even enjoys it. She wears long flowing dresses because she wants to and is entirely confident and sure of herself. I drew her in heels. 

My friend thought that was odd. He thinks of heels as something entirely unempowering. This is because every woman he has heard talk about heels says much the same things: they're painful, they're uncomfortable, no one wears them because they actually want to, etc. He thinks of heels as something restrictive and even in a way demeaning. 

I don't think this way, but I know there are women who find wearing heels empowering. That's why I drew the character in them; she embraces the politics and formal life and finds power in her ability to traverse it, so i thought she would be one of those women who wears heels because she wants to. 

The problem is, while he isn't calling me a liar, he can't wrap his head around the idea of heels making someone feel empowered or in control. I tried to explain it, but since I don't think that way I floundered. 

Part of what I'm looking for is confirmation that yes, there are women who like wearing heels and I'm not just imagining that. I also want help putting the idea into words. I've always been proud of the fact that I can see things from other points of view, and I want to help him be able to do that too, even if we still disagree."

1. **Socialization** Cowboys were way more popular than cowgirls. Hell, My Little Pony has a bigger following from grown men (bronies). Black Beauty novel? A single book or movie can't change demographics this much, can it?

2. **Freud**'s theory of ""phallic symbolism"" mumbo jumbo? If that were true wouldn't women also love monster trucks or Harley Davidson bikes? I don't really get this argument.

3. **Power**, grace, strength, majestic wild animals with wind in your hair is exhilarating. You can get most of that on a motorcycle. A kawasaki 750SS has 300 horse power, so it should be 300x more appealing to women?

4. **Care** of horses is very nurturing and fulfilling. Couldn't the same be said about alpacas, donkeys, bulls, llamas, dogs? What is unique about horses?

Why do you think equestrians are almost ALL women? And why doesn't it appeal to men?

My question is, why do they seem so unique?

The other fruits I know of--apples, bananas, kiwis, pineapples, etc--are all sweet to entice animals to eat them and spread their seeds that way.

And yes, I know the fruits we eat today are quite different from their 'natural' counterparts because of selective breeding. A truly wild banana would seem awful compared to the ones you buy in a store, having hardly any of the 'good part' to eat and big seeds. A wild apple is tiny and very tart, etc.

Still, it seems like even the wildest tomato must have had a very different base form than the other fruits, to today be more of a savory, unsweet fruit that is used more in sandwiches and soups than for a sweet treat for pies, eaten raw, and so on.

Did the wild tomato plant want to attract a certain animal consumer that was different than the ones that, say, the apple tree did? An avocado isn't really sweet either but it has quite a lot of calories (and it was meant for megafauna like giant sloths) but I can't imagine a tomato has the caloric value to make up for its lack of sweetness."

But it all sounds so ridiculous to me.

The point of politics is to reach an equilibrium between the ""rule-makers"" and the ""citizens"". It's to achieve a state where neither parties are being manipulated by each other. No politicians lying, no irresponsible consumers, just direct and linear development for the country.

I understand that political parties are ways for people to consolidate their general views, but at the same time it sounds so stupid. A communist leader can use another solution from another communist leader.

Since politics is just reaching that aforementioned equilibrium, the only point of politicians or political parties in general is to discern the best way to REACH it. 

A dictatorship can be good or bad depending on the dictator. A surveillance state can be good or bad depending on how it is conducted. All these political parties which people assign random behaviours to doesn't mean anything. Being a conservative doesn't mean you can't advocate for the LGBT community.

It just confuses me how people can talk about these political parties like they contradict each other. They are all a means to reach the same destination.

Rather than people saying ""My beliefs align more with fascism"", people are more likely to say ""I'm fascist, liberalism is weak"". Like I said, there is nothing inherently wrong with a dictatorship. It relies on the dictator. And there is nothing inherently wrong with ANY political system, it relies on how it is run.

So it's more like the people, not the system. So why do people keep talking like this? I seriously cannot relate."

I guess that's normal, that's how life works, but now we're seeing society split in two because of it which of course will cause some serious problems. I guess it wasn't a problem in the past because the one side wealthy white men had the majority of the power so you were either on their side or had no power. I suppose that now the power has dispersed into two more evenly matched oppositions that it's now a problem.

My question is now that we've reached this point in society, would it be better to put our politics to the side when first meeting people? My thought was that maybe if you get to know the rest about someone besides their politics you might be more willing to befriend them. Then when you're friends and you've related on a human level, when politics do come up you can thoughtfully have an open minded conversation about it and both sides would be more likely to listen and understand. I know this happens in families a lot and it's useless, but maybe on a wider scale it would lead to more understanding than what we're experiencing now. So do you think avoiding discussing politics could help or is it just the natural better way to get it all out in the open so we know who we're dealing with before we even start talking?"

Maybe the bow and arrow isn’t as far fetched. Because of the constraints of physics.

I dropped out of college a few years ago expecting this, and that is surprisingly the only life decision I’ve made post-high school that I don’t regret. You can observe a similar phenomenon with lawyers in that it’s a respected profession thought to pay well, but there are now so many junior lawyers based on those promises that it’s hell for lawyers now. Apparently. I don’t know any lawyers. I just read Reddit testimonials.

But not having a degree kind of sucks. I don’t qualify for like any jobs and my only skill is a basic ability to transform my persona into a milquetoast child to make customers feel better in a customer facing service job. I’m working as a fever screener during Covid, and everyone says they like me and that I’m doing a good job, but it’s a joke. My job could literally be performed by a machine with how little critical thinking there is involved. I want to apply to college for next fall, but I don’t want to go back and just fuck around until I drop out again or graduate with a degree in Communications. Any advice?

Tl;dr - STEM is beginning to die I think. What’s good still?"

k5qyi3,Are You Comfortable with Nike's Marketing Strategy?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/k5qyi3/are_you_comfortable_with_nikes_marketing_strategy/,OnceIWasYou,1,2020-12-03 13:10:43,2,/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/k5qyi3/are_you_comfortable_with_nikes_marketing_strategy/,NaN,"I find myself increasingly uncomfortable with Nike effectively trying to co-opt Civil Liberty and fights against prejudice as a tool in their advertising.

The recent headlines from their Japanese adverts make it especially clear that Nike are advertising their company and products under the banner of ""Fighting"" against discrimination in an obvious attempt to have an implicit brand association with these Social movements. It's hardly new and rather than the obvious ""Well, at least they're trying to help"" view that I've had in the past I feel they are now actively pushing certain messages and views in order to put the company in a prominent position whenever a discussion about those issues arises.

There's something shady and distasteful about it. No matter all the messages, clichés and dramatic narratives involved in them we should remember that these are adverts. They are attempts to increase sales and profit for that company- that is the objective and priority. 'So isn't it good that they try to do good things as a secondary objective?' is the obvious question. Possibly. But they now have a financial incentive for continued social unrest. They're certainly not a non-profit organisation. 

I suppose my issue is the idea this huge global Brand, which has used all sorts of incredibly cheap (you could call it slave) labour to make their products, who sponsor all sorts of athletes with dubious actions in their sporting and personal pasts, have had many complaints of Bullying and racism within their organisation and have been shown to make huge savings through ""Tax Avoidance"" (and Evasion) strategies lecturing the general public from a supposed position of moral superiority.

They are trying to piggy back on a current bandwagon in order to advertise. EVERYTHING we see publically from Nike is an attempt to maintain or increase profit- that is the number one aim and concern. All this Social Concern stuff seems like a very thin, brittle facade to project the Heroic image that they want.

The narrative being pushed in the Japan advert seems like a backfire of this tactic as it doesn't seem to have rung true or consistently enough so the Japanese public have understandably been upset by this seemingly unfair characterisation of their sporting culture- the point being Nike have seemingly misrepresented something in a very negative light in order to force their advertising template onto a different nation."

An individual biological organism will likely to cease upon a low threshold of physical damage (for a human it can be something minor like a cut on the wrong place) while on the level of society as an ""organism"" the resilience to physical damages is extremely high (you could basically take out 99% of the world's population and the humanity would still exist and rebuild itself after a while).

And long term can synthesized or lab grown meat replace traditionally grown meat in farms.

This new technology do have some good advantages like more human production so no animal cruelty or risks of new animal diseases outbreaks that can be passed to humans and more controlled environment to insure quality and health of grown meat . It is more ecological then traditional cattle raising technique and in a world facing a large climate change crisis it might  vital technology for humanity in the future .

They are several hurdles before such technology replace more traditional means of meat production :

1- economic problem : can it be produced at an acceptable price for both producer and consumer to be replicated at large scale ? Usually technology becomes cheaper with time and more R&amp;D. It have to become a competitive alternative to traditional means of production to have a market . What kind of ressources it needs and level of manpower and education to produce synthetic meat ? 

2- heath issue : does it offer same nutrients as natural meat same needs for human body ? Any risks short or long term from chemicals or substances in lab grown meat ?

3- can it be mass produced on a global stage ? Does it require high level technology and expertise or could be propagated with time ? Can every country produce such food or would it be reserved to more tech savvy nations ?

4- social stigma: this is more psychological and social norms . Here society to accept such new products would have overcome fears of it . Like is it really meat ? Is it tasty or satisfying to eat ? Is it actually healthy to eat ? . By example some insect can be eaten and farmed for high protein sustenance but it frown upon in a lot of societies . Me per example have insect phobia and wouldn't touch any insect."
